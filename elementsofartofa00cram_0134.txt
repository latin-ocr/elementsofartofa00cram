Let then each of these Portions of Metal, as they
are wrapt in a particular Paper, be put separately in-
to a new Crucible‚ never used for any Operation, and
adding a little Borax‚ melt thern in a very quick Fire,
which must be well kindled before with Bellows; or
what’s still better, throw them suddenly into a white
hot Crucible, and so soon as they melt‚ stir them
with a dry wooden-Peg, burnt at the End, and pour
them immediately into an Ingot. This mingled Fu-
fion may as well, and almost more conveniendy, be
made with a cementatoryTube (ᾗ 258). Next to this,
wrap each small Mass grown com, into *ts Paper again,
to avoid Confusion, and again try thern fingly in the
Balance. If they'stillweigh a whole Mark, they are
good: But if there is any considerable Deficiency in
the Weight3 it is a Sign that your Fire having been
too weak, or of too long a Duration, has consumed
ns much Copper, as is wanting in the VVeight: There-
fore instead of this small deficient Mass, another
must be made in the same Proportion. Then with
a Hammer, make a Needle (ς 289.) of each of these
small Marses, making them a little red hot, when the
Blera} begins to grow stiff under the Hammer. This
done, engrave upon eyery one of these Needles the
Nuniber of half Ounces of Silver which they contain 3
that is, upon the first, 163 upon the second 15 3 and
so on, Then piei-ce them at one End, and runSnilng a
