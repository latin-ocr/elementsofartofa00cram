tter. It is found yellow, white, red, and grey3 and
hardens in the strongest F ire to such a Degree, as to
give sparkles with a Steel.

N⁰ 3. Asbfstus, a Stone consisting of rigid and

stringy F ibres woven together, and cutting each other
acrosS. It varies very much as to its weight. It scarce
changes in the greatest F ire, except that it commonly
turns white, and becomes harder than before. There
is a kind of very light Asbcstus‚ called Suber Monta,-
num, which melts into a black kind of Glass ἕ.
, N⁰ 4. Amizmffius, or Earth-Flax, which is little dif-
ferentfrom the foregoing, except that its F ibres are pli-
ant and paralle13 so that the Virtuost make Thread‚
Cloth, and Paper, with a certain kind ofit. Itsustains
,a moderate Fire without being altered : But when it is
exposed to the greatest Fire, it either partlyor wholly
loses its pliantncss: This is chiefly true of that kind of
Amianthus, which is friable between the Fingers, and is
falssy called Alumen plumofitm .· For it hardens in Fire
to such a De gree, as to strike Light with a Steel †.

N⁰ 5. Ollarisss Ἡζεῇείι m Lap.' s, Pot- Stoma, which
feels exa-&ly like hard Soap: It is most commonly
somewl ιε transparent3 sofr, ponderous enough, and
very eaifily carved with a Knife. In the Fire, it turns
white, and hardens to such a Degree as not: to be snr-
pafl'ed by Flints‚ and to strike a Light immediately.
But it cleaves in the greatest Fire. A few kinds of
Tobacco-pipe Clay belong to the same Class,

N⁰ 6. Talae, it is a Stone consisting of small Scales‚
lying one upon another: It has a soapy feel: It is
sometimes tenaciou53 refists a great Fire, and suffers
there no other Alteration‚ but its becoming more brittle.

N07. Mica, Glimmer or Glis't, it is of the fore-
going kind3 ihining, and britc, hter, black, gold or
sllver colour' εἰς nor can it be conquered by either F ire
or Water.
