1fa ll into it, and you must make under it a Fire that
mk es it boil gently: B it you must first have a suf·
1fic ient Qantity of Lye ready, that you may be able
to fill the Pot eightor six Times at least. Nor must
you pour more at once than is necessary that the Pot ·
may be half-full, lest the Salt should form a Crust in
the upper Part of the Pot, that would be difficult
to separate. As* much Water as is diffipated by Eva-
poiution, so much fresh Lye must be now and then
poured into the Por. When the small Clotswof Sale
begin to thicken‚ and to appear in the Lye, and a
small saline Crust covers the Surface of it, diminish
the Fue, and with a Wooden-fcraper‚ or an Iron-
]adle, stirr it circularly‚ till there remains a dry pul-
verulent Salt. WVhen you see thiS‚ you may bake it
quite dry, without any further stirring. If you neg-
lect this stirring, and the Diininution of the Fire, a
very hard Crust of Salt will apply itself to the Pot,.
which cannot be separated but with a Mallet and
a Chizzle, and not without a Mixture of several Par-
ticles of Iron, by which violent Percuffion‚ the Pot
which is of melted Iron, and brittle, is frequently
split. Mix two Parts of this Salt‚ which will be
brown, or sornewhat yellow, with three Parts of pul-
verized* Finita, or of Sand ·, melt them together in a
great Fire‚ in which the Mixture being left for se·
veral Hours, will turn to a Ghss finer than the fore-
going, but less dur-,able because 1t contains much
more Salt‚ and the Mixture is not so perfest But
we cannot determine a εοῃίὶῑηῑ Proportion of the
Plints or Sand, and the Sais, because of the variety
of the Stones. For some Flints are more fufibre than
some others: It is the fame with the different Kinds
of Sand ·, which must be evinced by ExperimentS.
Salt produced in an Earthen-pan‚ put immediately
into the upperrnostdChaniber of the Furnace, or in
its Pavernent, and calcined with only a gentle Fire‚
lest it should mest, and freed of a great Qantity of
Fat vil ich it still contains, will become perfestly
