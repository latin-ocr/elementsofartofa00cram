Corollar. III. For the same Reason, the fatty
Matters added to Metals in order to melt them, put
them sooner in fufion, than the same Degree of Fire
could have done, without the ‘immediate Touch of
oil Bodies.

and Semi-Metals, that are destmffible by a naked
Fire‚ are much less destroyed, when they „melt under

only upon thern, are easily melted‚ and lose nothing,
provided both the Metals and Salt be perfefssy pure.
But if the Calas, Fi1ings, &a of these MetaIS, mixt

but a part of it is detained in the Salt swimrning at
Top. But when the Earths and Salts are mixt with
thern at the farne Time, the Lentor or Softness by the
Earth communicated to the Salt, and which no F ire
