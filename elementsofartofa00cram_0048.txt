the Recipient begins to grow warm, then continue
the same Degree of Fire, till all the Phlegm is ex-

pelled, which you will know from the Diminution.
of the Heat of the Recipient3 then increase the Fire
gradually, till you see a few ssight yellowilh Vapours
rise. Keep up the same Fire for one or two Hours,

and finally make it such as may warm the Vessels
moderately3 having continued 1t so for some Hours,
let the Veffels wax cold, pour· the Liquor, now emit-
ting reddilh FumeS, out of the Recipient into a Glass
Veffel, having a Glass Stopple, and this Liquor thus
prepared is your Aqua Fortis.

Scholion. I. In this Operati0n‚ you must always pro-
portion the Duration of the several Degrees of your Fire,
to the Qantitv of lhe Matter to be distilled.

Scholion. 11 Observe bcfides, that, for Security’ s
Sake‚ you are to leave in the Closure of the Recipient and
V ffel which contains the Matter to be distilled, α’ Hole
that may he stopt and opened with a Wooden Peg: For
if you happen to exceed the just Degree of the Fire, esve-
cially when, in the beginning, the first and more subtile
Spirits, which aie very clastic k, come forth3 the opening
of this Hole may give them a Paffag e, lest the Veff‘ls
should burst, which would be astly dangerous.

1 14. This Operation requires Nitre perfeftly pure,
that you may have true Aqua Fortis. Above all
Things, you are to avoid the least Mixture of Marine
Sale, for the Reason hereafter to be mentioned, when
we treat of Aqua Regia. Mean while, as this Ope-
ration is very toilsome, and takes a very long time -,
I shall hereafter give a Method for making Aqua
Fortis of the requifite Purity, and distilled out of a
N itre not even perfestly pure.

¹15· There are besides many other Ingredients,
commonly used in the distilling oquua Fortis: viz.
burnt Allum, Sand, and the like ·, which are here
added, to hinder the Species, which may happen not
to be sufficiently calcined, from foaming, and from
breaking the Veffel with great Violcnce. But when

these Species are sufficiently calcined, and dried uhp ·,
