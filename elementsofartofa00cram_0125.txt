ordinary Delicacy. 2. The Axis being a very fine
Peg, must be fastened with Solder, in the Hole
pierced in the Center of the Beam z Which is very
eafily obtained, ifyou cover over witha thiu Lamina
of Gold, the Middle of the Axis which is to go
through the Center of the Beam: For Steel may be
soldered with Iron by means of Gold, in a gentle Fire 3
otherwise you must use a more violent F ire, whereby
the Axis is easily destroyed. 3. To temper the Bearn
you must first, when it is white hot, extinguilh it in
cold Water‚ and then rub it all over with Oil, and
keep it upon the fise, till the Oil is burnt and con-
sumed ε And if you do this two or three Times over
in the sume Manner, you will at last give it a spring-
Temper. However‚ you must do this, before the
Bearn is quite worked. Next to this, you must make
again the Extremities of your Beam white hot, at a.
Candle3 that being made a little foster by this Means,
they may be bended without Difficulty ; and in Case
of Neceffity be lengthened or lhorrened, to be cor-
rected.

271. Ifthe Fault of the Balance confists in the lne-
quality ofthe Aruns, as to their Length orWeight‚ and
if it is good in any other Respec‘t, and you have not
Time to mend the Fault previoussy : You may use it
rhean while, in the following Manner. Put the Bo-
dy to be weighed in one of the Scules, and put in the
other, Weights to an equipoise : Then mark exactly
the Sum of the Weights : And then interchange the
J Powers, without however changing the small Dishes:

Mark likewise the Sum of theWeights‚ to be added
for the procuring osan Equipoise‚ which will cer-
tainly be different from the foregoing Weights : Then
multiply the Qantities of both these Weights by
ench other, after having first reduced them into very
minute Parts‚ as for instance into Drachms: And
finally, extra& the square Root of the Produce of this
Multiplication‚ which will marl< the true VVeights of
the Body in question.
