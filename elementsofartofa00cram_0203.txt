ASSAYING METALS. 185*

may be put in F usion 3 but then they evaporate at
the same Time.

451. When a Body melted (ξ 449.) and grown
colci, becomes brittle, fixt‚ not diffoluble by Water‚
and melts again when exposed to the Fire; then it is
called Class3 and the Operation which changes it in
this Mamer, is called Vitrification.

452. This Vitrification (ᾗ 451.) is made use of by
Metallurgists‚ to the End, that any Metal impri-
soned in a solid Body‚ may on account of its Weight
descend and separate itself therefrom ε and when the
Metal itself assumes the Appearance of Gluss, this
Operation is technically called Scorz‘fication, in Ger-
man fflierstljlathung ·‚ and the Glass thus produced is
called Scoriez, in German ᾢεῇῑειείςε, in English
Dross.

453. All fixed Bodies experience the same (§ 452.)
Alteration, not totally excepting even Gold and Sil-
ver. There are also among the volatile Bodies‚ some
that can be fixed, and which affume the Form of
Glass again, by adding fixing Bodies to them.

Scholion„ They also eall Scoria that saline Maſs,
which is produced by melting Metals and Ores, together
with fizline (ᾗ 159-166)‚ and reducing Fluxes : Nor
ought, however, the Word Scoria be then understood of
all this Maſs, hut οηζγ of the vitrified Particles which
adhere between the finall Maffes of the Salm, and which
may he st’paratecl from them by a Diffolzltion in Water,
cmd by Fz’ltratz‘on.

454. It is oftentimes proper, to make the Scorifi-
cation (§ 352.) in a Veffel, that may absorb the Scoria
itself, and retain the metallici< Part. In this Case, it
is called Coppelling. The Tests and affi-Veffels
mentioned (§ 168, 184, 185‚) are defigned for this
Operation.

455. Itis then sels-widem, thata great Attenua-
tion of the Scoria is requisite, that it may be able to
pass through the Veffel. Nor is there any fitter Body
for this Purpose than Lead, which by its sels under-
going a like Attenuation ,in the Fire ·, for this Rea-
