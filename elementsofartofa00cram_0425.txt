ASSAYING METALS‘. 399

the Sulphur was not yet united with the Mercury.nn
Therefore, you must add rather more than less Mer-
'cury, that all the Sulphur may be detained. Next
let the Fire not be too violent nor too precipitately
applied, because it confounds all the Ingredients to-
gether : Nor must the Necks of the Veffels be too
large. However, as Arsenick is employed pure for
other Uses, this Separation is never made 3 because
it requires a great Labour‚ and yet is never com-
pletely performed. For a great Qantity of Arse-
nick, separated from the Sulphur, adheres to the
white, shining‚ solid, distinet, small Maffes, which
are between the Sublimate of the Cinnabar, and the
small Drops of the Mercury that have not been dis-
solved by the Sulphur. Whence, the Cinnabar ap-
pears rather of a grey than a red Colour‚ and may
at last be totally separated, by repeating and well
pet-forming the Sublimation.

3. The Foundation of this Process is then, that
Mercury is diffolvable by Sulphur, and on the con-
trary rejects Arsenick. Therefore, as the other
Metals and Semi-metals have an equal Affection for
Arsenick and Sulphur‚ or reject them both, the Se-
paration of the latter by the former will not succeed 3
or if any Kind os it is obtained, it happens in an in-j
verted Proportion ·, for Instance, when the Sulphur
ascends easily, the Arsenick is detained in the Caput
Mortuum, which is diffipated by a strong and com-
monly an open Fire : If any is obtained, it is gene-
rally not true, and impregnated with Phlogiston.
