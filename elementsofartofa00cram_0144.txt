Scholion. Let us clear this Matter by the foregoing
Example (Schol. ᾗ 310). The Minerczl supposed there,
containing Copper in the greatest Part, is called proper
to Copper. But so long as Sulphur and Arftnick are
mixt together with the Copper, ond render it of ιι parti-
cular Species, this Mineral, on account of the small
Qantity of its sulphureons and nrst‘nz'cal Parts, is said to
be improper to them. Ii'inally, the Stones or other Bo-
dies placed about or among that Mineral‚ are called ac-
cidental to it, as they are no constituent Parts thereos, and
it might fiaebssst without them.

Of Sulphur and fidphureous Minerals.

312. Mneral Sulphur or common Brimstone, when
free ‘of all foreign Mixtures‚ is of a solid, friable
Confistence ς yellow, made up of large Maffe5‚ and
more or less half-transparent3 it burns, makes a
bluish Flame, with a suffocating aeid Vapour (ᾗ 22),
and thus is entirely consumed : Being put upon a gen-
tle Fire, and in close vessels, it melts without taking
Fire, and, when melred, changes its Colour into a
bright Red: it no sooner grows cold again, but it rea
sumes its Solidity and yellow Colour. It is composed
of the purest inflammable Principle (§ 24), and of a
much greater Qantity of Acid of Vitriol (ξ 22) ε on
which Account it sinks in Water, being much heavier
than pure Oil. The Chemical Analyfis‚ and the
Production by Art of true Sulphur, out of the two
Principles just mentioned, confirm what has been
said of it.

out of the Earth ; though not so very frequently : it
is likewise brought in such a State by Waters, which
on this Account are called particularly mefflcinal,
and it applies itself to the Walls of the Springs.
