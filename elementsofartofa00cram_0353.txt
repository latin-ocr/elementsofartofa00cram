,and solid : For these Kinds of Ores are very brittle
and light, and are comminuted more easily and finely
by pounffing, than the crude Stone itself: 'Whencethey
afterwards are, for the greatest Part, carried away by
Water.

4. Therefore, when you meet with Ores that are
difficult to melt, on Account of Stones interniixt with
them, and either not separable at all, or at least so
with great Difficulty‚ and never without some Loss
of the Ore itself, it is better to manage them accord-

PROCESS XLVII.

To find out Copper in a pyriloſs-Ore, by Solutimae, amz'
a liquid Precipitation.

F there is but a few half-Ounces of Copper in a
I Centner of the Pyrites ς they can never be found
out by a Precipitation by Fufion: For so small a
Qantity of Copper dispersed among so great a Heap»
of heterogeneous Mamer, is unavoidably burnt away
by so many repeated Roastings and F ufions. VVhere-
fore, a Method must be chosen, whereby the Copper
may be separated from the Ore by Means of liquid
Menstrua, and then again easily precipitated. The
Acid of Sulphur‚ which is already in great Plenty
in Pyrites, is very proper for this Operation. Make
a Solution of Vitriol out of such an Ore, by a light
Roasting in an open Fire, and by expofihg it after—
wards to an Air somewhat moist, and pouring warm
Water upon it : Nem, put into this Solution small
ison-Plates‚ extremely well poliffled, and perfeftly
clean of all Grease. If there is any small Quantity
of Copper in the Pyrites‚ it will certainly stiek close
to the iton-Plates‚ in Form ofa very subtile Powder,
ofa deep yellow Colour, and all of it will be fetched
out of the solution, if you have but Time enough,
and a moderate Warmth : Of which more hereafter,

when we treat of Vitriol. {y this Meam, the {eriz
