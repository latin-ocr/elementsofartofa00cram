01· the Oai-s of these Metals ·, the Eody of the Fornace
must be put upon the other Pedesta]‚ having aBed
in it (marm. Fzg. X). However, you must before
this open with a Knife the oblong Hole (c), and the
round one (d) of this bottorn Part, which are stopped
with the Lute sticking to the Infide. Then y'ou ap-
ply at the round Hole (d) on the left the Beliow5, in
such Manner that the Nozel ofit being directed οἱ),
liquely downwards, may blow strongly against the
Bed (fg h) : By this Means, all the Assies that fall
into the Bed are blown away, and the Strength of the
Fire determined to such a Degree‚ that all the melted
Bodies that fall into the said Bed, remain in their
State of Fusion : And were it otherwise, the melted
Bodies would immediately wax cold, and adhcre in
Grains to the Bed, whereas they ought to have melt-
ed into one Regulus. The oblong Hole in the fore-
part of this bottom-Part (c) serves to discover by
means of a Poker, whether the Matter in the Bed be
melted, or not ε lt serves likewise to take away
through it whatever might stop the Bellows‚ andin
some Cases to take away the Scoriae. Then you put
first Coalsinto the Fornace, one Span high, and blow
them well with the Bellows‚ to make them burn, that
the Bed may be very hot before the Matter to be
meited is put into it: For if this is not previoussy
done 3 the melted Mass seldorn runsinto a Regulus,
but remains dispersed among the Scorz'as which soon
grow hard. The Bed being weil heated‚ and fresh
Coals added to the Fire, put into it such Qiantity of
the Matter to be melted, as cannot hinder the Fire
from being carried to the requisite Degree : Which
cannot be determined otherwise than by Experience ε
Again, put fresh Coals, and upon them another
Quantity of the Matter to be melted ·, they may be
like Strata one upon another, But if the Mass once
melted could not long sustain the Strcngth of the
Fire; or if you had a mind to melt a greater Quan-
tity of Matter than what can be contained in the
Bed3 yon must open the round lower Hole (Plat. ΙΙΙ,
