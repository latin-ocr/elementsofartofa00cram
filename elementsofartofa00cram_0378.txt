‚⁴13 52 The A R‘r of

‘ melting Veffels, the Orifices of which rnust be of
equal Diameter. Then adapt an Iron-plate to the

Ι Orificeof one of the two Pots in such Manner, that
it may indeed rest upon the Brink of lt, but not jut
out too much all round: Let this Veffel have seve-
ral Holes bored here and there in it. Put it on the—
Pavement of the Hearth·‚ 5pour into it pure Water
about two Inches high; then {hut it with the Iron-
plate. Put upon this Plate a small Vessel of a leffe}-
Capacity, and full of a Matrix that contains Mer-
cury: Next‚ close these Veffels with the second Pot
inverted: Stop the Joint most striffly with Luce,
which must be applied pretty thick all round‘ Bury
the inferior Pot in Alhes and Stones‚ placed thick and
close round it, and heaped up to the very Jointr·
Put upon these Things a moderate Fire, and conti·⁴
nue it for about half an Hour, so that the upper Pot
rnay grow ssightly red hot. The Mercury that lies
hidden in the Matrix will diffolve into Vapours,
which being stopt above, will come down when again
condensated: They are preserved under the Water
from the too great Heat : For, thisdoes notadmit that
Degree of Heat whereby the Mercury may continue
in the Form of Vapours, or be resolved into Vapours
when once condensated ; unless there is some Air per-
feffly imprisoned in the Vefsel‚ and so inclosed as
not to be able to perspire: When the Veffels are
grown cold‚ open them, and shake well the Water
*contained in the inferior Por, that all the small Drops
of Mercury dispersed here and there, and adhering
to the Sides of the Veffel, may gather into one Mass.

The Ust’ and Reasons of the Process.

1. Mercury intirely volatilised is obtained pure by
Distillation in a moderate F ire, without any Destruc-
tion‚ and even without any Charge, unless the di·
gesting Fire is continued too long3 provided the

Distillation is performed with Discretion, and hno
