392 The ART of

2. If you roast the Refidue in a Crucible till it
smoaks no longer, or rather in an earthen flat Vefl‘el
not glazed, and in a strong Fire to be stirred now
and then with a Poker, and then weigh it when
grown cold, you will be able to know, how much

Arse-nick remained in it in the close Veffelss unless
the Ore contained Bismuth.

The Use and Reasons of the Process.

1. Arsenick is of itself more fixt than Sulphur‚
and is very strictly united to several Metals‚ Earths,

and stom, not even excepting Glass itself, and vi·
trescent Stones, and Salts: So that it remains with

them, though melted in the most violent Fire, eva·
porating but little, and carrying Part of thern away
with it, when expelled by a violent Action of the
Fire and Air: Which appears very plainly in the Cad-
mz‘a Formam, or Tutty. The Glafl‘es in which it
is sublimed, are also penetrated by its Vapour, so

that they grow mill< white throughout their whole
Substance : Which evidences its penetrating through

all Bodies. It melts with many of the Matrix’s in
which it lies hidden, when you suddenly apply to it
a middling melting Fire ε Thus in the white Pyrites,
which can hardly be conquered by Fire alone, be-
cause of the little Qantity of martial Earth and great

Ι Qantity of unmetailick Earth it contains, it turns

to a Mass in Appearance of a semi-metallici< reguline
Nature, but not so in reality : Because a great Part
of it is unnietallick, and difficult to be separated
from the Arsenick, unless you use a Fire increased by
Degrees‚ which at last forces the Arsenick to aban-
don the fixt Part of it. The same happens with
almost all Metals and Semi-Metals; nay‚ it adheres
also to their Scoria's and Calx's,' it melts with them,
and cannot be separated otherwise than by a ssow
Roasting. Arsenick is well fixt in pure Earths‚
and brings them to a Fusion without any Metal :⁷
For this Reason, when it is sometimes in small Qan-

tities
