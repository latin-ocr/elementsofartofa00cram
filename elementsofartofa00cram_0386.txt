360 The ART of

yellow Colour 3 according as the Roasting and Melt-
ing have been performed more perstffly, and in a

neater Manner
2. Kunkel has made Use of another Method of

roasting crude Antimony‚ in order to prepare a
greater uantity of the fimple Regulus of Antimony:

For, a greater Qantity ofit is obtained by that Me-

rhod than by any other· ·, lor, during this Roasting
the mineral Sulphur carries offa small Qantity of it.
But, if you urge it with a Fire too long lasting, and
so strong as that it may come almost to the Degree
of a reducing Fire, some Part of it is diffipated.
For Instance, the Calx of Antimony which is of itself
pretty well fixt, or the Glass of it, is disposed to a
Reduffion, when you urge it by a frequent Addition
ofa Phlogiston ; now, the Regulus is diffipated by a

Fire a little too strong, · therefore, the Glass or Calx ι

of Antimony is by this Method rendered volatile.

3. Nitre ground with Antimony charged with
Sulphur, detonates with the sulphureous Part, and
consumes it as to the Phlogiston3 but the Acid of
Sulphur being agitated by a wstrong Fue, and meet-
ing the Nitre, the latter expels the acid Spirit of the
former in a gentler Manner, and unites itself with
the fixt Bafis of the Nitre, and together with it con-
stitutes a middle vitriolated Salt‚ perfeffly like
Tartar vitriolute‚ or like Salt Polychrest, which

being washed off with warm Water, there re· -

mains the pure Calx of Antimony halfvitrified. But
if you use more Nitre, for Instance, twice or thrice

· as much for the Detonation, the Calx becomes yellow

or white, and is much burnt ς in the first Case it is
called manicham in the second DiczphorelickAntimony.
4. The Separation of Sulphur may likewise be
performed by several liquid Diffolutions, and by
Precipitation5: For which Reason it is called by
some Calcination or Roasting the moist WVay. Thus,
for instance, Aqua Regis, and Spirit of Nitre, espe-
ciilly when they are concentrated, erode the reguline
1⁴1bffance of Antimony ou t ok t’he Sulphur with a
moderate
