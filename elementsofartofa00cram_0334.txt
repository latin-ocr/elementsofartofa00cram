1. It is easy to conceive, that there is as great a
Difference between the several Kinds of this Metal
called black Copper, as there is between the pyri-
Vtose and other copper-Ores‚ accidentally mixt with
other metallick and semi-metallick Bodies. For, all
the Metals‚ the Ores of which are intermixed with
the copper-Ore‚ being reduced⁴ are precipitated [ος.
gether with the Copper3 which is brought about by
Means of the black Flux. Wherefore, Iron, Tin,
Lead, the reguline Partof Antimony, and Bismuth,
most commonly are mixt with black Copper, in a
Multitude of different ProportionS. Nay, it is self-
evident that Gold and Silver, which are diffolvable
by all these Matters, are collected in such a Regulus,
when they have been first hidden in the Ore. Befides‚
Sulphurand Arsenick are not always altogether absent.
For they can hardly be expelled so perfeffly by the rna-
ny preceeding Rmstings, but there remain someVesti·
ges of them, which are not disfipated by a sudden
Mesting, especially in a close Veffel, wherein the
F lux swimming a-top hinders the Aetion of the Air.
Nay, Arsenick is rather fixt by the black Flux, and
affumesareguline semi—metaffick Form, while it is at
the same Time preserved from diffipating‚ by the Cop-
per. But, the Variety of the Colours, of the Con·
sistence, and even of the Goodness of black Cop-
per depende on this,
