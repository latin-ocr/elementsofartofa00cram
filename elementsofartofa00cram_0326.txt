and is full of Pores; and if the Copper is not a
quarter or a fifth Part less than the Portion of Lead‚
and the Fire has been made gentle and ssow, you
will find that it has intirely preserved the same
Figure, which the Mixture had before the Eli-

quztlogind the Weight of the Copper with a Ba-

lance, and put the whole, or the melted Part of it,
into a Test, or, if you are only willing to try it, put
it into a small Coppel well heated, and sufficiently
hot, till the Lead is intirely'consumed‚ and the Cop-
per remains motionless ε Then take it out immedi-
ately, and extinguish it in Water. You will find the
formerWeight of the tried Specimen diminished ε But
the Part ofit which is deficient, will be the Lead de-
stroyed : And as Lead mixt in small Qantity with
Copper, consumes about the fifteenth Part of the Cop-
per, with regard to itself ·, for this Reason, you
must add the fifteenth Part of the deficient Weight
to the remaining Copper, that you may have the
Portion of Copper, which has been left by the Lead
in the upper'· (Νο. 2.) Bed. Thence you may eafily
calculate‚ how much Copper may be separated from
Lead‚ If you put the melted Lead into a Coppel,
you will find not only the Portion of Gold and Sil·
ver which was in the Mixture‚ and which the Lead
has carried away with it 3 but you will know alsO,
from the pure sulphureous yellow Colour of the
Coppel, or from its greater or less Blackishness,
whether nothing, or a little, or a great Qantity of
the Copper has vanished with the Lead ς though you
cannot however, from this, precisely determine the

exa& Qiantity of it.

enough to be in fusion, does not diffolve Copper ε

when you do not exceed this Degree of F ire: But,
