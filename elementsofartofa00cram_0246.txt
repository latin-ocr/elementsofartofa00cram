you pour carlessy upon them a Calx that gives a Co-
lour, you will never obtain that they may be equally
died on every Side·, even though you should torture
them for whole Days together ln a gre at Fire. Nay,

Glass already made, can never be Operfeffly diluted, .

by only pouring Salts and Litharge upon it: Where-

sore, you must use the Artis-icc of glass- Makers‚

wh0‚· iu the making of the most perfeft Glaffe8‚

take great Car,e before they put the Species of the ir
Ing1ed1ents into the Fire, to have a mechanical Mix-
ture proceed, or at least accede during the Fufion it·
sels: Which is done here by pounded Glass of Lead
mixt with the Ore, But if you think that your
Glass of Lead is not sufficiently fusible, you may add
to it Litharge melted first, and then pounded into a
fine Powder.

2. As this Scorification requires a longer and
greater Fire than the foregoing, and as a greater
Qantity of Litharge is moreover requisite, to sub-
due the refractory Scoria; it is easy to see, why a
much greater Qantity of Lead must be used here,
than in Process 1 τ And though less Lead is often
sufficient3 it is nevertheless proper, always to use
the greatest Qantity that can be neceffary3 lest,
sor Instance, it should be necessary to try so many
Times the Lead alone·, to make it evident, how
much Silver, the Lead‚ when alone, leaves (Proc. II.
ΝΟ. 5. ) in the Coppel. Nor need you fear, lest any
Thing os the S1lx er may be taken away by the Lead3
provided the Coppels be good, and they Coppelling
duly put in Execution3 for you can hardly collest a
ponder ble antity os Silver, out of the 601]εᾶεά
Furne ot the Lem, which rises during the Coppel-
liug, as well as out of the Litharge that is withdrawn
into the Coppel.

3. If it happens that the Scoria grows clammy,
and adheres to the Sides of the Veffel to such a De-
gree, as that it can hardly be poured out, and thus
¹retains something of the Regulus : Some, 1n this

Cas'c, are used to add coal-Dust‚ or the Caput Mor-
