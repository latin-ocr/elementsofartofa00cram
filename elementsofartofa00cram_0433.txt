“ fallen upon it, swirnming a-top‚ let the Veffels

grow cold, and put thern in a cold still Place for‘
one Day and one Night‚ that Crystals may gather,

which must be collecied by decanting the remaining

Liquor of the Solution. Dilute the Refidue with the -
double Qantity of Water‚ filtrate and inspiffate it,

and set it by for Crystallization, as before 3 till what:

remains at last refuses to turn any more to Crystals‚

but assumes an oily Confistence. Confider every

Time separately the Crystals produced, to see whe-s
ther they have the Properties of Vitriol (Part l. §417).

But in each Crystallization, an Oker ofa yellow Colour
- will be produced, which is expelled in a greater Qan-
tity‚ as the Inspiffation is performed more ssowly
and inequally, or even when the Solution is kept too
long at Rest, though it be perfeffly transparent‚

v 1. There are many Ink-stones that conceal different
Kinds of Vitriol confounded together (Part Ι. § 417.)
and sometimes Allom into the Bargain. The latter
is very ealily distinguished, when the Inspissation
and the Crystallization are discretely performed ε By
which Method some Salts may be separated from each
other, which being confounded with an Inspiffation
too hastily made, cannot be well distinguistied. The ι

’ Difference which is between these Vitriols‚ proceeds

from a Variety of the Proportion, in which the *green
Vitriol of Iron ⁹¹* and the blue Vitriol of Copper † are
joined to each other. Allom itself mixes with them
pretty often, which appears clearly, if you distil
Oil from Vitriol‚ or calcine this strongly, and edula
corate with Water the Caput Mortuum which is very
red. This Water being inspiffated and crystallized,
produces whitish Crystals, which are called Gilla
Paracelst [1, and have concentrated in them the Allom
