attempting a complete precipitation at once: It is
better to separate only the Part which is first expelled
out of the Scoria’s ·‚ and these afterwards are exposed
to a reducing reiterated Fufion: Which Method is
the more beneficiah because these Scoria’s serve somea
times instead of a Mea-firman to melt other Ores,
and thus leave at t'ne same 'rime the Metal remaining
in them.

2. From these Things‚ might perhaps be explained
the pretended Observation3‚ how a new Generation
of Metals has been operated‚ by the Influence of the
Stars and of the Atmosphere, in Scoria’s rejected a.
great While ago,

3. The perse& Scoria coming out of pure Cop-
per, out of Smnes, and other vitriffied Bodsts, is of a
blue Colour. But, if there is in it more Copper not
quite vitrified‚ it looks reddish ; and the neore still,
as it contains more Copper: Wherefore, a great
Qantity of Copper may also be reduced out of such
a Scoria. But this Colour may be intirely obscured‚
by the Addition of many other Badies, especially of
metallick ones: Which is chiefly effected by Iron 3
because a small Qantity of it gives the Scoria’s a
very black Colour. For this Reason⁹ you must
never neglec‘l: a docimasticarl Exarnination of the Sco·
ria’S. But the metallick Regalus’s which are precia
pitated out of them, are as various as those produced
by the Ores themselves. For, the Regulus which is
precipitated out of the Scoria’s of (Proc. XLIlI.) the
pyritose-Ore, is much coarser than the first Regum
proceeding from it : For a precipstadng Iron lies
hidden in the Scoria's united with Sulphur, when the
greatest Part of the finer Metal is expelled ε There-
fore, the Regulus which is especially called by the

Germans &thlatktsstm'm is more sull of Iron and
Sulphur. Thus, all tne Regulus’s produced from

the Scoria’s are commonly less good than those ob-
tained by the foregoing Proceffes : Because there is a
greater Number of heterogeneous, and chiefly of
tixt Rodien, in the Scoriar's, which, on this Account‚
