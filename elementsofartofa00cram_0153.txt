Veffel or Trough. These kinds of Ores are called.
decantable, (in German ztbiehige.) They are known
to be such : 1. from the great specifick Gravity of
the Ore, which shews us that the metallici< Maffes,
adherent to its Matrix, are large and solid, not too
small and dispersed. 2. From the Lightness of the
stony Matrix. 3. From the Brittleness of the same,
either natural or procured by burning it, or by ex-
tinguishing it in VVater, which Brittleness renders the
Comminution easy. In this Case however, it is pro-
per that the Ore itself be sufficiently fixt, and do not
fly away by burning, or at least that it should thus
melt into small spheroidal Mafl'es. Among fimple
Stones‚ the vitrificable ones (ᾗ 29.) and the calcareous
(ὅ 30.) are of this Kind ; and among those that are
not affected by Fire (ᾗ 31.) the chalky, and other

sofr, light, brittle Stones.
338. But when Stones containing an Ore in them,

cannot be separated from it by the above-mentioned
(§ 337.) Helps, they are called indecantable, (in

German OElnstbiem'ge.) Such are light brittle Ores,
that contain a great Qantity of Sulphur, and are in·

’ terspersed with the minutest Maffes of the largest Sur-

face of the Particles of the Matrix, or inclosed in a
ponderou3‚ hard Matrix, especially of that kind that
cannot be affected by F ire (§ 31), and which neither
Fire nor Water can split3 ς

self, while the Ore is exposed to the Fire, then such
an Ore is said to be hungry, minem rapax. The
Causes of this are commonlyArsenick, Antimony, and
those Minerals out of which Zink is produced.

340. The three Differences hitherto explained
(§ 334—339.) must always be chiefly regarded, in
the distinguishing of all kinds of Ores: Therefore,
