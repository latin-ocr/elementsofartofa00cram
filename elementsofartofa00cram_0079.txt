ASSAYING METALS. 63

through the Holes made in the Eafis of the Muffel,

b it.

yCoroll. Therefore‚ when you are to fix the Helght‚
Length, and Depth of Muffels‚ you must consuler,
how many Veffels„ and of what Size, are to be intro—
duced at once into it, and that the whole Infide of
the Veffels‚ both foremost and hindmost, may be
within the Reaeh of the Affayer’s Eye : To which
last Point you must havea special regard. But most
commonly they are of the requifite Dimenfion, when
four lnches high, fix or eight Inches long, ancl four
or fix Inches broad. The Segments cut off at the
Bafis for the leffer Holes‚ must be so high as thar at
least the small Vefl‘els put under them, may not be
tainred by Coals and Affies falling into them: For
these hinder the Vitrification of Lem-J, and the De-
struc'lzion of the other NIetals and the Semi-metae,
and reduce thern entirely when already destroyed :
But the Scoriae spoiled by Affies‚ soften and retard the

Operation.
¹97- You must have wooden Moulds‚ for the

forming ofthese Muffels‚ (Plat. Ι. Fig. 13).

198. The Matter which they are made of, is the
same as that of Tests (ᾗ 183) ·, provided it 'oe a llttle
more moistened and pliant.

199. To form your Muffds, guther in one Mass a
sufficient Quantity of Clay prepared (§ 198.) and
moistened‚ so as to be somewhat pliant; kneecl it
well with your Hands, put it upon a Plane of Smne,
or any other that may be not much changed by the
Moisture ·‚ extend the Mass evenly into a Cake 21 lit-
tle longer than the Muffel to be made, so broad as
to exceed a small Matter the Border of the said Maf-
fel, and so thick as that two or rnore thin Laminas,
about two geometrical Lines thick, may be cut off
from it : Which is eafily done, by rolling upon the.
Mass of Clay a wooden Rolling-pin, strewed 'first
lightly with Ashes or Chalk. 2. With a thin bross
Wire well stretched out, cut off from the [Ta-ke
