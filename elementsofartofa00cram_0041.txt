83. Bismuth (§15.} causes the Jess fufible Rffeta-Ia

’ to mest, by a much less Fire than they would, if they

were to be melted fingle: It mixes eafily with them
all, and according to the greater or less Quantity of
it added to thern, it renders them more or less white,
br‘itrle, and Semi-metal-like.

84. But Bismuth being so easily destroyed, itis pro-
per that the Mixture of it with Metals difficult to be
melred‚ be made in close vessels, that the Fire be in-
ceffantly increased‚ and the other Conditions sulfilled,
which are mentioned (ᾗ 59.)

85. It is very observable, that Bi muth melted with
Lead, Tin, or Silver, disposes them ΓΟ, that being
afterwards amalgamated with Mercmy, they are infi-
nitely more attenuated‚ and pass through the Leather
together with the Mercury‚ in much greater Quantity
than they would, if there was no Bismuth (§ 67.)

86. Zink (§14.) mixes eafily with Lead and Tin,
and, according to its Qantity, renders them less mal-

stage·- He that is willing to melt Zink together with

’ Metals not very sufibIe, must use the Methods pre-
scribed (ᾗ 59.)

88. When it is by Fufion mix'd with four Times
*the Quantity of Copper·‚ it becomes a brittle Metal,
of a fine Gold-Colour, calied Prince Rupert’s Metal,
Prince’s Metal, or Bath Metal.

89. Kt is moreover observable, that Zink is very ra-
pacious: Which Qality of it is not so easily corre&-
ed by an Addition of Iron, as is in the foregoing Semi-
Metals. For, by the Help of a greater Fire and of
Air, it sublimes all mix'd Metals; so that they ad—
