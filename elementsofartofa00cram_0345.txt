what you get by a greater Operation ·, provided the
Copper be well purified in the small Trial.

Another Method.

1. Take black Copper, chosen in the same Manner
>as before (Νο. 1.) and break into small Pieces a Qantity
of it a little rnore than two docimastical Centners: This
may be done very well with a Hammer and a Chizzle ;
that the small Bits may be made of the Size of large
Pieces of granulated Metal ε Then reduce it to the exa&
Weight of two Centners : Weigh also two Centners of
pure comminuted Copper: Add to each, being granu-
lated, an equal Weight of pure granulated Lead, not
having the least Appearance of a Mixture of Copper,
which may be distinguished from a dark Colour remain—
ing in it, when you vitrify it alone in a Coppel: Wrap
up both these granulated Metals separately in small Bits
of Pa er.

2. Ιξυε two Coppels under the Muffle, and heat them
for a While with a strong F ire ε This done, put your
granulated Metals into them; and bestow all your Care
here to hinder the Aetion of the Fire from being
greater upon one Coppel than upon the other. How-
ever, let the Process be performed with a pretty strong
Fire :When all the Lead is consumed, and the Smoak
ceased, take both Coppeis out of the Fire, as nearly
at the same Time as poffibly you can, and extinguiffi
in Water the remaining Beads of Copper: Then
weigh them, and as much as there is wanting of
the two Centners of pure granulated Copper, so
much are you to add to the Regulus remaining of the
two Centners of black Copper ς because a like Qan-
tity of it has been consumed by the Lead: But if the
black Copper contained Lead of iffelf, observe be-
fides the Difference of the Weights of both Regulus's‚
and add furthermore the fifteenth Part of it. You
will have gathered by this Means the Weight of
pure Copper that may be fetched out of the black
one. Let, for Instance‚ the Regulus remaining of the
