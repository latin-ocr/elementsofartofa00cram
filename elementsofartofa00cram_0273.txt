ASSAYING METALS. 247

the Fire must be increased. If on the contrary, you
hear a violent Blast of An* coming forth with a loud
eracl< ling Noise, though you havet) not put the above-
mentioned Coal at Top, the Fire is too violent, and
must of Course be diminilhed. Which being neg-
lested, you will not only suffer a great Loss of Sil·
ver3 but large Veffels, charged with a great Qan-
tity of Nitre, now and then burst asunder with Vio-
⁴lence and Danger.

3NVhen this Phenomenon is over, increase the F ire
as much as is necess‘ary‚ to make the Silver melt with-
out any Addition ε Take the Veffels out ofthe Fire:
Break the under one, when it is grown cold: You
will find the Regulus of Silver at Bottom, and alka-
line Scoria’s (commonly green) at Top. lf the Sil-
veris not yet sufficiently purified, or too rigid still,
put it into another Crucible, and this thus open into
a wind-Furnace, throw upon it a little Nitre, and as
soon as it rnests, pour it into a Mould for Ingots:
'ghltjis it will be purified of every thing that’s not

The [ss and Renfhns of the Proceſs.

1. We have already considered (Part 1. ᾗ 137,
161.) the Action of Nitre upon Metals and Semi-
Metals. Therefore, if you operate in a due Mamer,
Silver is, by this Method, rendered perfeffly pure
and easy to be bent. But if your Silver is very im·
pure, a small Matter of it is destroyed in this Opera»
tion ; which must be ascribed to the strong Detona-
tion of Nitre with other Metals‚ and to the Clamnri«
ness of the Scoria’s made by their Calxs.

2. The Nitre in this Procel‘s seems partly to be-
come volatile, and partly to change into a fixt Alkali,
so very pure, that there rem-ains not the least Foot·
step of Nitre: For when you pour upon it Oi} of
Vitriol‚ it does not in the least excite the unpleasant
Smell of Aq ua Fortis, which nevertheless is commonly
