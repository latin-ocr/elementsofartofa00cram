¹·7'2' The ART of

is made when two Bodies‚ melted together, and yet
not mixing perfeftly with one another in the Fufion‚
separate of their own Accord into two Strata, on
account of their different specifick Gravity. This
Precipitation might indeed be made in the same Ves-
se* wherein the Fufion is made : But, in this Case,
you would be always under the Neceffity of breaking
the melting Pot every Time ·‚ because the Part pre-
cipitated cannot be got out of it, when this Veffel is
intire. Therefore we use for this Work the above-
mentioned kind of Cone, into which the melted Mass
is poured, and out of which it may be eafily taken,
when the precipitation is perfect. But as the Qan-
tity of the Matter to be precipitated is often but
small, the conical Figure has, on this account, been
affigned to the melting-Cones, doubtless‚ that the
heavy Matter subfiding to the Point of it, may be
collected into one solid Regulus.

221. The melting-Cone is rnade of Copper or of
Brass, that the Infide of it may be sufficiently po-
liss1ed. When it is made of Brass, you must take
care that it be not made too hot : For then, when
you strike it with any force, it eafily splsts, on ac-1·
count of the brittleness of this Metal in a great*
Fire.

222. When the Qantity of the melted Matter to
be precipitated is considerable ς you may use, instead
of melting Cone (ᾗ 22 1), 'a large brass or iron-Mor-
tar, or any large iton-Veffel whatever.

223. Finally, when melted Metals or Semi-Metals
are poured out, in order to be examined closely, or
afterwards affayed in part ·, it is proper in the pouring
out, to give then] an oblong Form not over-big: Be-
cause they, by this Means, are more eafily divided‚
and cut into small Bits. In order to this, they use a
Set of Moulcls (Plat. ΙΙ. Fzg. XX.) called an Ingot,
having one or many prismatical or semi-cylindrical
Fun-owe, of different Sizes, and well polished‚ with
a very long Handle‚ and made ofIron, the properest
Matter for this Instrument.
