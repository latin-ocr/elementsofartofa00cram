vifionS‚ the Compofitions and Numbers of which
may be easily known from (ξ 290). But you can
hardly distinguish any thing offilver-Allay‚ by your
Needles, when you divide beyond half Loths.

292. You may also add to these filver-Needles
(ᾗ 290.) one made of pure Copper : For with these
you may at the same Time find out the Purity of the
Copper, or its various Mixtures of Silver.

293. In Hollcznd they use the Mint-Mark (ᾗ 285)
divided into Grains, for the making of NeedleS.
But then, the first Needle made of pure Sil'ver‚ is said
to ‘be twelve Penny-weightS. The second is made 01³
eleven Penny-weights and eighteen Grains, by
the Addition of fix Grains of Copper. The third iq
made of eleven Penny·weights and twelve Graius,
with twelve Grains of Copper3 and so on : the Pro-
portion of the Silver decrealing always fix Grains at a
Time, that is, one quarter Part of a Penny-weighr,
and that ofthe Copper being always increased in the
same Proportion ·, till at last the *vVeight of the Sil-
ver is diminiihed to one Penny-weight, and the an-
tity of theCopper augmented to eleven Penny-weights z
Which Proportion constitutes the last Needle, beyond
which you are not to proceed.

294. However‚ it is needless to go through the
whole Series of the Needles, by so small Progreffimis,
to the very last. It is enough for us, to have indi-
cated quarter Parts of a Penny-weight to one Needle
of nine Penny-weights (ᾗ 285), and the half-Ounces
to one Needle of ten Semi-ounces (ᾗ 284) 3 for af—
terwards, you cannot accurately distinguilh Propor-
tions so very delicate, in the following Needles.

295. Gom, when you are to make gold-Needles,

must be mixt either with Silver alone, or with Silvegj⁸
