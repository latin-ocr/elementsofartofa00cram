by small Holes, lets the Regulus flow out of it.
The Vefl‘els that are most subje& to this Inconveni-
enee, are those in the Materials of which, Lime‚
Plaster, and Chalk are mixt: Nay‚ these Bodies‚
which are of their Nature refractory‚ being eroded
during the Scorification‚ at the same Time commu-
nicate a great Clamminess to the Scoria3 so that a
great Qantity of the Mass rem-ains adherent to the
Test, in the Form of Protuberances‚ when you pour
it out; whereby a great many Grains of the Regulus
ure detained.

6. There are a great many Affayers‚ who take
for a Sign of the Compleatness of the Scorification,
the Qantity of the Scoriae 3 that is, when these have
covered the whole Surface of the Lead. But this is
very uncertain: For, if the Test is a small Matter
narrower‚ and of Course as much deeper, or if you
scorify silver-Ores that are less rich ·, then indeed
the Regulus of the Lead will be covered over with
the imperfect Scoria‚ long before the Scorification is
perfect. The Qality of the Scoria is a much surer
Sign ·, and this must appear quite vitrified, according
to the Description of it given (Νο. 4. of the Appar.)
In the mean Time, the—Colour and Brightness of it
differs according to the Variety of the Ore ·, how·
ever, it is most commonly brown, or black, and opa-
que, which is owing to the Iron and Copper, from
which the Ore is seldom altogether free: For these
Metals tinge Glaffes with very deep Colours. The
Colour of the Scoria is seldom half transparent‚ red-
dish, or yellow‚ like Rosm. But when these Cha-
raeteristicks are wanting, you may be sure, that all
the Silver is not yet precipitated out of the Ore, as
it ought to be: Therefore the Fire must be in-
creased.
