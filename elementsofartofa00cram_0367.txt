rating them, which are certainly difficult ς because
we find almost every where non-Ores, that are both
richer, and of a better Kind.

3. This Fufion and Reduftion of the iton-Ore by
Stratification with Charcoal, succeeds with grear.
Difficulty in a small portable Apparatus .· For, be-
fore the iron-Ore can be put into the Fire‚ the Walls
os the Fornace must be very red-hot: Which cen.-
not be done without some Detriment to the Apparatus,
unless the Inlide be done over with thick Lute *.
BefideS, ifthe Lute is not of the best Kind‚ it is almost·
consumed by so violent a Fire, and by the Scoria’5‚
as are likewise the Walls of the Furnace. It is bet-
ter, for this Experiment to make a small Furnace
with Stones‚ in the Hearth ofa Smith’s Forge 3 then
the Operation is finished in the same Mamer, as a
like Process with Copper. NeverthelesS, a still more
violent Fire is required here ; and Scoria’s ofIron‚ or
some other very fnfible Stones, sometimes together with
Lime, must be put into the F urnace before and with
the Ore to be tried 3 not only to promote the Melt-
ing, and to separate the Iron from the heterogeneous
Bodies‚ but also that these Things swimming upon
the Regulus, may hinder its being consumed by the Fire
and the Blast. The Furnace must be kept 'very full
with Coals during the Operation, and but a small
Qantity of the Ore be put in at a Time.

PROCESS LV„

The melting of crude brittle Iron, to make it malleable.

TO restore Malleability to Iron, the Bodies which
render it brittle must be separated, and the Par-
ticles of it be made to stick closer to each other, that ’
every heterogeneous Manet, lying hidden in its Inter-
sticeS, may be expelled. This may be conveniently done
on a Hearth like that of a Smith’s Forge‚ having a Bed
