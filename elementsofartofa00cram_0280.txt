254 The ART of

PROCESS XVIII.
The Separation of Silver from the Amalgama.

APPARATUS.

Pread a thin Leather upon a wide earthen or

, glass- Veffel, very clean: Fold it up in the
Form ofa Bag, and pour the Amalgama into it:
Then tie the Bag very strongly at Top, that the
empty Spaces of the Plaits may not glve Paffige to
any Part of the Mercury This done, if you com-
press the Bag by wringing it hard, the major Part of
the Mercury will pass through it, and run into the
Veffel under it. If you can no longer squeeze any
Thing out, open the Bag, and you will find in it a
white Paste, which shall be the Silver and the Gold
that were in the wassit Powder: But there remains
about an equal Qantity of Mercury still mixt with
them after the Squeezing

2. Put the remaining Paste into a glass Retort·‚
and this into an iron- Pot full of Saud (Plat. IV.
Fz'g. I.) ε Apply to it a Recipient‚ in which there
must be such aQantity of Water‚ as that the Orifice
of the Neck of the Retort may be immersed into it ε
Nor is it necessary to close the Joints with Lute.
Make under thisa strong Fire, till you see the Mer-
cury applying itself by large Drops to the Neck of
the Retort‚ and falling into the Water, with'a his-
smg Noise: But if you hear a Crackling in the Re-
tort, then diminish the Fire a little; and if at last
nothing more is distilled by the great Fire, let the
'Retort grow cool‚ then take it away, and split it
with a Thread dipped in Brimstone‚ which, for this
Purpose‚ must be tied about the Middle of the Belly
of the Retort‚ and set on Fire: Then in the F ire
with Borax run the remaining Metal into a Mass,
