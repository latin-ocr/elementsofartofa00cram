same Aqua Fortis which you have used in the foregoing
Process; then wash off the Salts with Water, roast,
and after having compared the two Refidues in the
Balanee, weigh together the Gold remaining from
the two half-MarkS. Thus you will have found out
with Certainty‚ and to the very least Weight, the
Qantity of the Gold, which at first you could but
have gueffed with Uncertainty: Substracft from this
Weight, as much as has been left of the Silver in the
same Qantity, according to Proc, XXIV. Let us
then suppose in the present Case, that the two small
Plates of Gold remaining, weigh twelve Carats and
fix Graius, and that the Refidue of the Silver, ac-
cording to the foregoing ProcesS, is two Grains in
the whole Mark of Gold: Therefore, if there re·
mains a little more than a half-Mark of Gold, you
must substraft one single Grain3 and there will re-
main twelve Carats and five Graius,

§The &er and Reqsbns of the Proceſs.

1. Observe befides what has been said in the fore-v

going Process, that you are not to impioy any other
Aqua Fortis, but that wherewith you have tried the

remaining Silver: For suppofing the other Opera-
tions to be the same, the Difference of this Aqua Fortis
makes the Difference of the Refidue. Therefore‚
you must repeat the foregoing Process as many Times

as you use other Aqua Fortis.
