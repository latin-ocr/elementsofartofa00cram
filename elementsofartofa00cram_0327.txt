ASSAY-ING ivlssTALS. 301

so soon as the Lead begins to grow white, to smoak
and boil, it soon diffolves Copper: Therefore‚ you
are to take Care, that the Fire be not too violent,
especially in the Beginning. But the most simple
Operation of the Eliquation, is that which is per-
formed without any Addition.

2. The small ison-Plate is applied, to the End
that, in case a few small Particles of Copper should

Paffage left, as through a Sieve, while these Parti-

cles of Copper remain.

PROCESS XXXVI. ·

To reduce and precipitate 'Copper out of cz pure mzdfhfi-
hle Ore„ in a close Veffll.

A P P -A R A T U S.
1. MIX one, o‘r‚' if you ,haves >small *Weighta

two docimastical Centners of Ore beaten
extremely fine, with fix Centners of the black Flux‚
and having put them into a Crucible οι· a Por, cover
thern one half-inch high with common Salt, and press
them down with your Finger: But let the Capacity
of the Veffel be such, that in may be only half-fulb,
shut the Veffel close·‚ put it into the Furnace, and
make the Fire as in Proc. XXX.

2. Increase the Fire ssowly‚ till you hear‘the com-
mon Salt put upon the' Ore crackle : Then increase
the Fire immediately, either with the Funnel and
Cover put upon the Furnace, or with a Pais of Bel-
lows applied to the Hole of the bononi-Part, that
the Veffel may grow very red hot. Thus you will

'¹ precipitate and reduce your Copper in about a Quir-

ter of an Hour: Then take out the Veffil, and
strike with a few Blows the Pavement upon which

you put it, that all the small Graius of Copper may

be colleffied in one Ivi-ass. B I
