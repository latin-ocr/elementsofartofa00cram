happens in common Affiaey-ovens3 ‚md again, that·-
the smaller Coals, almost already consumed, and the
Ashes, may more easily fall through the Interstices of
the Grate, and the larger Coals still fit to keep up
the Fire, be retained. Finally, I have added the
Funnel (plat. ΙΙΙ. Fig. I. t.) that the blowing of
the Fire being, by means of it, increased as much as
possible, this might at last be carried to the requisite
Degree: For-“the Fire may always be diminiffied‚
but not· always he increased at Pleasure, without the
Assistance of a p oper Apparatus.

2 39 The other Furnace neceffary to the Affayer
is called a melana Furnace, and is likewife corn-
paeted of Iron Plates. The Cavity of it may be
formed according to the elliptical Mould (Plat. ΙΙΙ.
Fig. V). 1⁵‘‚ Make an hollow Ellipfis, the Focus's
12 Inches astinder, and the Ordinate 5 Inches l-ong3
cut it off in both its Focus’s‚ that it may affume the
Figure (Plat. ΠΙ. Ρζξ. Vl). 2⁶¹7, Then make in
this hollow Body, and near its lower Aperture, four
Holes‚ eight Lines in Diarneter, and direffly oppo-
site (c c). 3⁶¹& Then fasten two flat iron-Rings (d),
almost one Ineh and a half broad, at both the upper
and the lower inward Edge of this oval Cavity ; and
fill the Inside of it with small iron-Hooks, jutting
out about fix Lines, and three or four Inches distant
from each other. These, together with the Rings
just mentioned, serve to fasten the Lute. Thus will
the Body of the Furnace be made: Only you must
add at the outfide two iton-Handles (e e), to be ri-
vetted on each Side ofit‚ that it may be taken hold
of, and moved. 4⁸³¹& Then make the Cover of the
Furnace, which rnay be formed like the Part cut off
from the Ellipfis (ἦρ. V. a) (See FQVII). Let
this have an opening (b) made in it, four Inches high,
five Inches broad at its lower Side, and four Inches
at the upper ; and adapt to this an iron-Door hung
on Hinges to shut it close, and having at the Infide a
Border fastened to it, answering exastly to the Cir.
cumference of the Door, and as prominent inwardly-
