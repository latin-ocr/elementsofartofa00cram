260 The ART of

We have then nothing to do here concerning Gold,
but to give the Methods by which Gold is separated
from Silver, and those by which it is separated from
the other Metals ·, as far as these Methods differ from
those which we have already given, for the Separation
of Silver from other Metals.

PROCESS XXI.

To render Golcl 20⁶1&stthqu from Silver, by Aqua
egis.

APPARATUS.·

1. H F, Mixture of Gold and Silver, must first

T be coppelled according to Proc. ΙΙ. or VIII.
with a sufficient Quantity ol Lead, that the other
Metals may be separated: In which a little more
Lead is preferable to a lefl'er Qantity. Out of the
remaining Regulus forge thin Plates; and whenever
the Metal grows rigirl under the Hammer, make it
red-hot in a gentle pure Fire, whereby its Duffility
will again be restored.

2. When the said Plates are sufficiently thin, make
them red-hot for the last Time, and cut them into
small Bits with a Pair of Sheers, and then keep them
in a warm Place, in a Cucurbite made of transparent
GlasS, pouring upon thern a sufficient Qiantity of
the purest Aqua Regis, which must be strong enough.
In the mean Time, let the Orifice of the Cucurbite
be ihut close with a Cornet of Paper, to prevent
any Dust from falling in.

3. The Diffolution being finished‚ pour out softly
the supernatant Fluid into a wide open glass-Vess‘el ;
taking Care that the least Part. of the Silver, adhe-
rent to the Bottom in Form of a white Powder, does
not go out along with it. Pour upon this remainingCalx
some Phlegm ofSpirit of Salt, and make it boil with
it a While, that the refiduous Diffolution ofGold may

be washed off, and added to the first by decanting.d This
