110. Silver‚ Mercury, Leuci, and T in, are, in
the Heat of the Ebullition‚ rather corroded than dis-
solved by this most concenerated Acid. Though
some of them be at the same Time so far dissolv-ed,
as to pass through a Filtre‚ and may be wassied with

Wiltrei· Gold is almost quite free from the Action of

this Acid.

1 12. Aqua Fortis and Spirit of Nitre are the same,
and differ only by the Manner in which they are
made. For the former is distilled with Vitriol and
Colcothar‚ and the latter with Clay, Bole, Oil of
Vitriol, Brick-dust‚ &a But the generality of As·
sayers use Aqua Fortis, as being more easily pre-
pared ; because a Qantity of Vitriol‚ much less than
the terrestrial Mixturesjust mentioned, with less Fire
also, expels the Spirit out of the same Quantity of
Nitre. This Distillation of Aqua Fortis is made as
follows,

1 13. You put Vitriol in an Earthen or Iron Pot :
If you make a Fire under it, the Vitriol begins to
melt and smoke3 by increaling the Fire gradually,
it thickens and affurnes the Ash-colour. Let it be then
stirred with a Twig just before it becomes solid, till it
be perfectly dry : But lecit be taken as yet boiling out
of the Pot ε For ifit grows cold therein, it will stick
to it so fast, that you will hardly be able to get it
out. Pound in a most subtil Powder three Pounds
Weight of this calcined Vitriol‚ and mix them per-
feffly with four Pounds of Nitre well dried, and pul-
verized extremely fine. Put all these together in a
Cucurbite‚ a Retort‚ or an Iron Por, and then put it
in a Furnace, that shall be described in our Chapter
of Utenfils, where the rest of the Apparatus hereto
belonging will likewise be explained.

Let then the Fire be made, at first not much

greater than is necessary to make VVater boil. Wthn
