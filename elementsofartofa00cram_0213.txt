AssAYING METALS. 195

Therefore, Artificers make 1t their Study‚ always to
observe exaffly the Proportion just mentioned:
Whence‚ the Reason and Origine of the Narne
Quartam †, is self- evident.

&Coroll Now, from what hasbeen said (ᾗ 471 .) it is
easy to conclude, how fallacious the Examination is
made with Aqua Fortis alone (ξ 3.ο3) of the Gold

that has been rubbed against the T oueh— stone.
473. Edulcoration ³¹⁶ is called a kind of moist

(§ 471.) solution, when the saline Part adhering to
a solid Body not diffoluble in water, is diffolved by
an aqueous Fluid‚ and then the Solution is separated
from the remaining Solid, either by subsiding‚ or by
being passed through a Filtre· and this is repeited
over Dancl ov er, till there remains no senfible Qantity

-of the saline acrid Body.

474. It is propei in this Operation (ξ 473) to in..
‘large the Surface of the Body to be edulcoiated, by

pounding ofit ·, that the Solurion may have a speedier
Success: foi· which Puipose indeed, they moreover
break ¹it in Pice-es, or stir it with a Stick : That all
the Particles of the Body to be edulcorated‚ which
otherwise would smk to the Bottom, may on all Parts
,be contigimus to the Particles of the washing Fluid :
by Which Artifiee all SolUtions are facilitatem Like-
wise‚ boiling Water is sometimes reqiiifite: lor tlie
'Herm by the inward Motion and Raretafflon it oc-
castoris, promotes in an extraordinary Manner all sa-
line Solutions.

475. Howwer, a perse& Abluti0n of the Salt, is
not always obtained by this (ξ i74.) Method : for, as
every Part of the Menstruum, contains in> it a pro-
portionable Quantity of the Body to be diffolved

(ᾗ 471), and there remains always some Part of the
Men‘isuum in the Body to be edulcorated ; it is as
evident as Light itself, that there remains at the same
