least Qantity of Copper is detefied in Iron, when
you make well saturated Vitriol‚ with Spirit of Vi-
triol diluted and perfeftly pure. The same may also
be done with several metallick Minores, in which
Copper enters: But it would be too long here to
mention the several Methods to be observed in this
Case3 and the Person that makes the Operation will
easily find them out,

PROCESS XLVIII.

{The Separation of SilverLanff Copper hy Fufion with
ea .

ET the Copper be freed of all heterogeneous
MatterS, by the Methods prescribed in the fore-
going Proceffes: But the Gold and Silver being
much more constant than Copper itself, remain there·
in in the foregoing Operations. But, the Copper
must be tried, before it is intirely melted, to know
whether the Qantity of Gold and Silver it contains,
will repay the Charges of the Separation. For, this
Separation must be made with Copper still impure,
called black Copper, by way of Fufion with Lead :
Because this Separation does not succeed as well with
melted Copper ε See the Reason of this (Part Ι. §468,
469). Bestdes, any Portion of the Lead remaining

in the Copper after the Eliquation, renders the Melt- ,

ing of the Copper more perse& and easy, than if it
was performed without Lead. It will not be im-
proper, to give a short Exposition of the Reasons of
this Process: Eut whoever is desirous to know the
several and peculiar Furnaces, Machines‚ and Ways
of proceedffig, fit for this purpose, let him peruse
the Writings of Ercker '³2 Agricola †‚ and others,
whose Methods have been reetified by a certain Au-
