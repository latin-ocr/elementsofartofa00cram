the white, thick Smoak that comes out along with
it. For you always see, and with no small Pleasure·
too, a Flame of this Kind, especially towards t'ne
End of the Operation. Therel‘ore‚ outof the vast
Qantity of Ores, which is at several Times put into
any one of the Furnace8‚ within the Space of 28
Hours, and which is more than fixty hundred
Weight‚ not reckoning the additional Ingredients‚
you will hardly obtain three, four, or at most five
Pounds of Zink.

Coroll. It is then plain from what was said (ᾧ 408

’ and 411.) how difficolt it is, to pass any certain

 

Judgment upon the Ore of Zink, as it proceeds
from so great a Confufion of Ores and Minerals, and
in so fingnhxr a Manner.

412. However‚ there are besides the Matrixs of
Zink hitherto mentioned, that are found at Gestar,
some others which may be called Zink-Ores. To
this Class belongs especially the Lapis Calamam-is,
or Calamine, in German (ῑὸᾶίηιερ, and also nali-ve Cad-
mia, to distingniss] it from thatwhich is called(§ 89.)
Rtr‘fm'ce-cadmia. This is of a F igure altogether ir-
regnlar, sometimes spongy, and now and then solid.
It is yellow‚ gold Colour, red, sometimes grey, or
even of a Colour which is a Mixture of all the fore-
going: As for the rest, it is not very heavy, nor
hard: when ronghly broken in Pieces, and thrown
into a violent Fire‚ it immediatly renders the Flame
ofthe Colour mentioned (ᾧ 14), and exhales a white,
thick, copions Sinos-k, which however has not the
Smell ofSnlphur or of Arsenick‚ but a sweeter Smcll
peculim· to it, and vastly astringent, and which con-
densites into very light Flowers‚ which are at first
bluish, and then ofa greyish White. Only take care
not to make this Experiment with such Bits of the
Lapis Cgcffaminar·is‚ as are accompanied with the yel-
tlow sulphnrcous Pyrites (§316>‚ or with the white

ν Arsenical one (§ 323), or also with lead-Ore (ξ 373) τ

for they now and then happen to be associated with
this kind of Stone. Belides, the volatiledPiart'just
