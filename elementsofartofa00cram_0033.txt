Assm‘me METALS. 17

46. This Glass or Litharge pounded together, and
melted with vitrificable StoneS, (ς 29), makes them
tu‘rh'i‘nt'o G'lafs with a much less Fire thhn they would
hav'e done by themselves 1f you add a sufficient
Qantity of Litharge, these Stones melt into a kind
of Glass so very attenuated‚ that it insenfiblyperspires
through the Veffels ·, nay, it melts the Veffels them-
selves, when they yield not a free Paffage to it.

47. All Lime-Stones (ξφ), if used in the sa'me

Manner (§ 46.) and mix'd with Li'tharg'e, have the
same F ate, but they require a much greater Quantity'
of Litharge,·to acquire the farne Degree of Fluidi-
ty, when melted.
x 48.¹ Stones' tha‘t' keep unburnt in the Fire (ξ 31.)
are more difficult to be changed, and unless some me-
chanical Mixture is used, aud a moderate Fire pre-
served a long While, the Litharge vanishes through
the Vessels that contain it, before it has perfeftly
melted' these Stones.

49. Among Metals, Litharge likewise facilitates
the Fusion of Copper and Iron by Fire, but at the
same Time it consumes a considerable Qantity of
them, and runs itselfwith thern into Glass‚ as is plain
(ᾗ 46.) from what has been said. But the Glass of
Lead does not mix as much with these Metals before
they are destroyed, as' it does with the aforesaid Stones·,
but swirns about and upon thern.

50. Tin and its Calx (ᾗ 10, 41.) is with great Diffi-
culty vitrified by a Mixture of Litharge‚ for italways
separating from it, swims upon it. But ifit turns in-
to Glass at last, it preserves a certain Clamminess‚
not to be taken away except by a considerable Addi-
tion of Litharge. The Vitrification of its Calx, is
in some Degree promoted by Copper: Which being
added t0‚ and melted together with it, makes it more
easy to be conquered.

51. The melting of Gold and Silver is likewise ha-
stened by Glass of Lead (as §49.) and they lose no·
thing by it. However‚ if Gold and Silver are very
‘frequently melted with Litharge, they at length prove
