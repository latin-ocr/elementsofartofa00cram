add some kind of fat Body, that prevents the De-
strucflion, and reduces Metals already destroyed:
And this is the more necessary, when Calxs prepared
either by burning, or by a Detonation with Nure,
are to be reduced. The Flux proper for this Opera-
tion, is very well prepared in the Manner following :
Take one Part ofcommon Nare, of crude Tartar, tho-
roughly dried, two or three Parts; pound them sepa-
rately into a very fine Powder3 then grind them well
together3 put them into an Earthen Pot, narrow at
the Orffice, not glazed within, and of a Capacity
three Times larger than the Powder requires: Which
done, put them on a gentle Fire. So soon as the
Mass begins to be inflamed with a Noise‚ shut the
Orifice with a Tile. After the Detonation‚ this will
produce a black, oily, alkaline salt, easily fulible in
the Fire‚ called Flztxus Nzgem or blial< Flux ·‚ put it
into a Pot closely stiur, and in a dry warm place, to
prevent its growing moist.

Coroll. Tartar being burnt alone in Veffels closely
ssiut, or detonated with Nitre, is most quickly al-
kalized, and thus retains a considerable Part of the
Oil which it contains abundantly, and which is fixed
enough. For this Reason, it very easily turns into a re-
ducing Hux. This Flux, therefore, on account of its ,
alkaline Salts, dissolves Earths and stanes, and changes
them into an imperfecst kind of Glass (ᾗ 97.) by a
moderate melting Fire. But the Oil being ofa more
fixed Nature, still remains concealed therein, andis
requilite both to preserve Metals from being destroy-
ed, and to reduce such as are destroyed already

S9cholion. I. If the Petis glazed within, and part
of the glazing comes off, and mixes and melts with the
Flux‚ it is again reduced to Lead, and thus may disap-
point the Artificer : Bemuft, this Crust of Glass is ap·
plied to Pots with Litharge or with Leacl.
