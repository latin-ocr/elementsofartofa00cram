mixt in different Proportions‚ and called by different '

Names. Likewise, the white, grey, and ash Co-
lours, &a of Sulphur, depend upon the various
Mixtures of Earths partly metallick and partly un-
metallick, with the same : Its very Confistence is on
the same Account changed to such a Degree‚ that
you can hardly judge from its outward Appearance,
that it is for the greatest Part Sulphur. This may
be seen in the Sulphur, which, during the Roasting
of pyritose Ores made in a half suffocated Fire, runs
sometimes between the Bits of the Ore, and being
vollen-led when grown cold, is called in German
ffimpfistljmefcl. Sulphur vive, or native Sulphur‚ is
likewise found under various FormS. But you will
enfily find out bya gentle reetif'ying‚xvhat Body is mixt
with the Sulphur in any Case whatever.

does not always suffer an effential Change ·, but re-
mains uncorrupted in a close Fire : But, when oily‚
fat, alkaline, and such like Matters arejoined to it, the
Texture of it is destroyed. The combined Astions
of too free an Air and of the Fire² destroy it: Be-
fides, in an open Fire, the inflammable Part of it
takes Fire, and is consumed. Wherefore the aeid
saline Part being a second Time diffingaged is by the
burning Phlogiston resolved into a most suffocat-
ing Fume, and again is very greedy of Water, which
it intirely rejetfled in its Conjunftion with the Phlo-
giston. Whence‚ this Acid may then be also very
well colleRed by Means of water or of its Vapour,
not being intirely <lisposed of itself to gather into
large Drops, and apply itself to the Sides of the
Veffels. This aeid Fume of inflamed Sulphur‚ is
commonly colleehed, by purting a Bell or a large
Alimbeck over it, and is called Spiritus Sulphuris per
Campanam, Spirit 01· Oil of Sulphur by the Bell.
But it is most conveniently colleeled by the following
saffiqsaratus. Take a Cucurbite‚ as large as you can
find it, not yet cut off at Top, and with a hard,
cutting, ssiarp Plini, mark in the Belly of it a square,
