reddilh3 but if it is mixt with Sulphur‚ it looks
blackish, and is very brittle: But the same Effe& is
produced by the serni-Menan, as by Sulphur and
Arsenick. Nevertheless‚ the Separation of the two
latter has already been made in the foregoing Pro-
cess; but the Copper must be separated by a peculiar-

Apparatus.

APPARATUS.

1. Make with Lute ancl charcoal—Dust a Bed, the
Capacity of which must be proportioned to the
Qantity of the Mixture of Lead and Copper to be
separated. But let this Bed be very low, and declin-
ing forward towards the lower Part. Let there be a
small narrow Channel running from the Bottom of
the Bed, to the other Bed which is contiguous to the
fore—Part of the Former, and placed a little lower.
In the Place where this Channel leads out of the End
of the upper Bed ς put a small iron-Plate‚ and press
it across the Channel still moist 3 in such Manner,
that there remains only a small Pafl'age at the Bottom
of it, through which the melted Lead may run
slowly. Dry the whole well, by putting red burn-
ing Coals thereon.

2. Put the Mixture of Copper ancl Lead into the

the Lead to a F usion ε This being melted by Degrees
and ssowly, will run through the narrow Paffage left
between the small iron-Plate and the Bottom of the
small Channel, and will be collested into a Regulus,
in the lower Part of the foremost Bed. If nothing
more runs with this Fire, make it a little stronger,
till the Bed grows dark red-hot ε Continue the Fire
thus for some Minutes; and then put it out.
