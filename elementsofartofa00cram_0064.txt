when used as a Gentem, takes likewise something from
Silver. But Gold remains untouched‚ in all the afore-
said Cernents. The other MetaIS, and all the Semi-
Metals, whenever they are inter-mixed with Gold (if
this be granulated‚ or reduced into Lamina's) are
eroded from it by Cementation 3 this however is some·
2 what more difficult for Silver3 but Copper, when
mixed with Gold in greater Quantity, is consumed
pretty soon : Nevertheless‚ a small Part of it remain-
ing in the Gold, is so strongly defended by the latter, ’
that it is a difficult Matter to separate them perfeffly
by Cementation.

ments, shall be described in the following Part, when

Faculty which causes them to be called Fluxa, you

they want to make Minerals in a small Qantityi

stones as are vitrificable by a gentle Fire ·, or the Sco-
rz'oe made of the same δίωκε when melted, which
serves this Purpose still better: For the more often
these Sto-nes have been exposed to the Fire, the more
eafily they are put in Fufion ε The Reason of which
seems to be the alcaline salt, proceeding from the
Fewel of the Fire, and adherent to the said Scorioe
