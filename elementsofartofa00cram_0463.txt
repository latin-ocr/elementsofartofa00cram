’ Fire continued long, very much promotes this Beau'ty

and Duration. A more perfect Mixture is obtained,
and the superfluous Salt diffipated by the same 3 be-
cause the fixt Alkali vanishes in form of a white
Smoak ε But, it is impossible to dissipate it intirely :
For, part of it is most intimately joined by the flims.
Thence now it is plain, why Glaffes of different De-
grees of Beauty and Durableness, are produced out of
one and the same Mixture, it proceeding from the
different Degrees of the Strength and Duration of
the Fire. For Glaffes taken suddenly out of the
Fire, grow obscure of themselves in the Air, and
sometimes sall asunder into Powder, though thejust
Proportion of the Stones and Salt has otherwise
been observed: Which will also happen the sooner,

if there is more δειῙῑ m the Mixture than ts requifite.
