the Workman may be deceived by the Colour, so
as to take for pure Gold or Silver, what is not such
by the greatest Part. You find out the Deceit with
Aqua Fortis, when the metallick Mass is of the Co-
lour of Gold ·, and with Aqua Regis, when it is like
Silver : for the first of these-Liquors dissolves all Me-
tals‚ Gold excepted ·, and the other likewise all Me-
tals, but Silver. In such Case then, you pour upon
the metallick Streak‚ or thin Crust rubbed upon the
Touch-stone, one fingle small Drop of either of these

will be consumed : but if there is any Gold or Silver
in it3 this remains undiffolved, and shews another
Colour 3 because the other Parts have been separated

their Colour, but also entirely recover all their
Splendor there, when tarnished‚ not losing the least
part of their Weight (§ 6, 7) ε on account of which
Qality the Caratura alba, or white Allay, is distin-

Liberty to try the whole Mass in the F ire3 you
may make only a small Part of it white hot, with a
blow-Pipe (ξ 258). 2. If you find a Needle, whose
Colour agrees with that of the Metal to be tried 3
both the Streaks imprin ted upon theTouch-stone‚ must
undergo Cbanges altogether the same, when Aqua
