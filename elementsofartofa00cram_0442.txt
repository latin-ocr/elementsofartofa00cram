The Preparatz'on qf Nitre.

APPARATUS.

1, E have spoken of the Generation of Nitre‚

or Salopetre (Part 1. §437, ὃς) ; there
remains that we should treat of the docimastical Ex-
traftion and Purifying of it. The Preparers of Ni·
tre, commonly throw a few Pounds of the Earth) in'
which they suspect there is any, into a wooden Vessel
with double the Qantity of warm &Vaten and stirr
it several Times with a Stick ε Then, they put two
small Copper-Dishes of equal Weight into one of the
Scales of a Balance that is pretty true, and a doci·
mastical Centner into the other Scale: Theywput some
of the Solution drop by drop into the former, till an
Equilibrium is obtained. They put the Scale which
contains the Solution upon the Ashes‚ or upon Sand
that is middling warm, to make it thoronghly dry,
and weigh it again, to know how much there remains
of the Centner of 'the Solution of Salt, Then they
take the Salt out of the Scale, and taste it, to see
whether it is nitrous 3 and put burning Co'als upon
it, to try whether it will deflagrate 3 which shews you
that the Nitre is pure, if there remains little or no
Alkali at all ; but if it decrepitates and flies asunder‚
you may judge that it contains a great Deal of Salt,
and then the Nitre proves the worse.

by the following Method. Take many com-
