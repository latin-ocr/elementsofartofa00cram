pens, that the Examination indicates a greater Qan-
tity of Silver and Gold, than the Mixture out of
which the Specimens have been taken, does in Reality
contain. But this may be avoided, if you snbstra&
that Part, which the Specimens taken together have
lost ‘in the F ire, from the Centner or docimastical
NIark ε That the remaining Part may be of equal
Value with the Whole z Thus the Silver and Gold
remaining after the Operation‚ will perfeffly answer
to the Qantity contained in the whole Mass of the
Mixture.

2. When Lead enters into the Mixture together
with Copper, the Ingot ought never to be extin-
guished with VVater: For the Copper growing cold
on a sudden in Water, εοηῑῑειξῒε, and repels the Lead
still in Fufion towards the Outside‚ and towards that
Part of the Ingot which is immersed the last into the
Water. Likewise‚ the Ingot is always ,richer in Sil-
ver and Gold, in the Plaee where the Cone has been
inclined towards the Horizon‚ than it is in the oppo-
fite Extremity : Which is especially true of those
Mixtures‚ in which Lead and Copper enter together.
The Reason ofthis is sels-evident, from what has been
fiiid at the Beginning of this Process. But the Copper
must be tried before it is roasted, to see whether it
contains Silver, or Gold ι For after that, their Sepa-
ration is hardly wortlrthe Charges (Part Ι. §468‚

3. Old Utenfils and Coins may be very well tried,
if previoussy granulated. For when the Boiling hap-
pens to render them white, or when the Metal with
which the Allay has been made, is not mixt in an
even Manner, you are infallibly deceived. Now,
they are rendered white by all such Bodies, 'as corrode
Copper the moistWay‚ and leave the Silver untouched.
When such Silver is allay’d with Copper, you must
first wipe it very well, or make it ssightly red in the
Fire ·‚ that the rat Filthiness may be diffipated. Then
put it into a brass-Kettle tinned over, and pour upon

it enough of tartish SmallBeIZn or of Water‚ thgtlthek
