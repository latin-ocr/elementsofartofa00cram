mity to the small Hook of the Plate (i), which is
then introduced into the Hole of the inferior Arm (h).
Then you put the Support (§ 265.) in the Middle of
the small Case (ᾗ 266), and you pass the other Ex*-
tremity of the silk—String below, through a Hole
»hored in the Middle of the lower Border of the F rame,
containing the 'Window in the fore Part of the Case,
and fasten it to a Weight of a few ‘Ounces (K), re-
duced into a cubick Form. Next to this, you must:
suspend the Fork of the Balance (Fig. ΙΙΙ.) on the in·
ferior Hook of the Plate (i) Fzg.V1). By this Means,
-if you move backwarcls and forwards, the Weight
fastened to the 'String (K), placed upon the Top of
the Draw, that juts out beyond the fore Part of the
Case, the Balance within ais either l-ifted up, or let down.
But you must put the Bodies to be weighed, and the
VVeights themselves in the small filver-Diffies(Fig.V),
and you put these,when loaded, into the StaleS, through
the fide-Windows, which must be opened for that
Purpose. When any thing isto be added to, or taken
‹out of them, you do it with the small Pincers, ot, if
’it is Powder, with the small Shovel 01· Spoon, How-
ever, you must let the Balance down, every Time
¹any thing is to be added„ or taken away ·, that the
‘Stales may rest upon the Bottoni of the Case : But
then you must shut the 'Windowffi before the Balance
vis lifted up again, especially if the Ait is not perfeet-
sly calm (PlatN. Fzg. VH.)

268. To see whether the Balance (ᾗ 264.) is just, or
no, you must interchange the small Dishes. That: is,
you first put the said Dishes into the Scales, and lift up
the Balance‚ to see whether it is in equilibrio, or
-notz If not, you will procure the quzz'lz'brium, by
adding granulated Lead to the lightest Diffi. This
Equilibrium once obtained, you put the Diffies in the
Place of one another, and again list up the Balance:
lf it keeps still in equipoise‚ it is a Sign of its being
just: But if after the Permutation of the Dilhes, you
mo longer find the Balance in equilibrio ·, it is a sure
sign of its being faulty. Moreover‚ when the Ba-
