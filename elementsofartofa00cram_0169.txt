AsshY'ING METALS. 151

what Part ofit lies hidden therein. Pound the Luni}
into a Powder not very fine, and wall] off from :c
with VVater the light terrestrial Filth that is in ir.
Then with a flat, not over broad Shovel, made quite
white hot, and having not a high Bor< er sprinkle
your Ore, afr er having pounded‚ Owalhed, and d. icd
it, and divide it in such Manner, that it may not he
heaped up in any Place, but quite spread: This must
be done, that all the ΓΡΓΞΞΞΙζΙεά small Parcels of the
Ore mayD orrow red hot quick enoug 0,h and that tle
small Stones which may happen to obe under or in-
termixed with them, may not, in their flying asun-
der, carry a confiderable Qantity of the Ore aW1y

with a gentle Noise, as also the heavy intermixed
Ores of other Metals that are less well washed3 be-
cause there is hardly any of these, that can bear a
sudden Heat: There will remain the tin-Ore, be-
come of a reddilh Colour, and covered with a kind
of grey arsenical F lowers.

382. The Garnate is reckoned among precious
Stones: its of an unsettled Figure, though most com-

monly dodecae'dral †, regular enough, not rare, half
transparent, and having its Name from the Flowers

of Pomegranates of which it has the Colour. This
now and then contains Tin ·, so that on this Acconnt
it deserves to be reckoned among the Ores of this
Metal. Nevertheless, all kinds of Garnates ought
not to be referred to this Class. For they fell, under
the same Name, Stones that have indeed the same
Colour, but are more transparent‚ vitream and are
rather of the Nature (ᾗ 29, 4) of Flints.

383. The tin· Ores mentioned (379, 380) which
are rendered refraffikory by the Srones and Earths
mixt with them, may among the other Ores he very
well improved by washing and roasting‚ on account
of their considerable Weight‚ and Constancy in a
middle F ire. But they can never be totally freed
