For, in order to this, the Calxs of Metals are most
commonly necessary: Because, the Calx of every
Metal, even the least Qantity of it, tinges Glaffes
with a specifick Colour. Therefore, that you may
with Certainty produce the Colour desired : It is ne-
ceffary that your Met-als be of the utmost Pureness:

5³¹„ ow, this can never be effmsted without docimastical
O'zperations: For, when but one thousandth Part of
Metal mixes to the Tritt of which Glass is made,
that is to the Mixture of Salts and Flints‚ to which
Litharge or lead-Calx is sometimes added, your
Glass is immediately tinged with some Colour,
whereas it was to have none, but be quite crystalline.
But if you are willing to give your Glass a certain
Colour, to be produced by the Addition of one or
many Metals‚ another Metal mixt with it in ever so
small a Qantity, changes it entirely 3 hence it is so
very difficult to give the purest ruby-Colour to
Glaffes.

is likewise absolutely necessary, in the making of

lation to the Nature of Fire, and its ΕΗέξὶε upon
mineral Bodies: That you may know, whether the
Body under Trial is pure, or no: Unless you have a
Mind to indicate an uncertain Cause for a certain
one, and to see always some new Event resulting
from the Repetition of the same Experiment.
might here alledge many Reasons‚ to demonstrate
this Affertion: Were I not obliged either to call in
Qestion with great Reason, or intirely to annihilato
those Experiments, which are so much valued by the
Multitude‚ and illustrated with Speculations which

their Authors are extremely fond of. But a Word
to the Wzse is enough !
