PROCESS LIX.

The reviving of Mercury out of the fidphm·e0us Cimm-
bar-Ore (Part 1. §402.).

APPARATUS.

E A T yourOre extremely fine, and mix it exa&⁶ ⁵

ly with an equal Portion ofIronF ilings, not 1usty:
And use the same Apparatus as in the foregoing Pro-
ceis,01·1n Ptoc. XVIII, but urge it with the strongest
1 we that can poffibly be made3 the Mereury will
thus be mvived.

‘she Use and Reczsom of [he Process.

1. When you have a Minci to separate both these
volatile Mineruls, you must fix one of them ε Which
is done by any fixt Body absorbing Sulphur: Such
as Lime‚f1xt Alcaline Sllt of wlnt OKind soever, Re-

Culus of Antimony‚1nd chie Hy 1r0n2F01‚ these
must adhete to the Sulphur alone, and no way to
the Me1·cmy.'1hus will you revive any Mercufy
‹harged with Sulphur, and even diffolved by Acids.
It is observable in this Reviving of sulphurated Mer-
cury by Iron-filingS, that there does not come forth
the Odom· of Miheml Sulphur, but an unpleasdnt‚
and most fingularSmell‚whieh being condensated into
am unStuous rancid Matter, darkens the Sides ofthe
Vcfflh, and makes the WVater turbid‚ into which the
revived Mereury is received. But this Reviving,
when accurater performed, shews that in the best
Cinnabar, Mercury is above seven Times the Qantity
of the Sulphur. -

2. Cinna-bar may be separated from Stones by Sub-
limation, thus: Beat it to a fine Powder, and put it
into a small, marrow, glass, or eat-then Cucurbite,

the Be lly of which, it must not fill more than ὶ0ηὲ
