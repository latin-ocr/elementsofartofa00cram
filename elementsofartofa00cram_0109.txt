snut closely with an iron-Slider, having a Handle to
it (rr), which Slider must move freely between a
double iron square Frame (ssss) fastened in the
Walls of the Funnel, at such a Height from the
Hearth as shall seem convenient to any Artificer⁸
10.⁴Below this Chimney, let a square. Aperture be
made, like the foregoing (N0 6. gg), leading oblique- Ι
ly up to the Bottom of another cylindrical Cavity
(u u u u), which is eight Inches deep, described by a
Radius of fix IncheS, open at Top, and there con-
verging inwardly into a Border one Inch thick, and
fix Lines broad, defigned to support an iron-Pot.
Likewise, cut in the anterior Wall of this Cavity,
and at the upper Part of its Mouth, a Segrnent two
Inches and a half deep, five Inches broad, and stoop-
ing forward (v v), to receive the Neck of a Retort.
11. To this Cavity (N0 10.) belongs an iron-Pot
(w w), eleven Inches broad, and about nine Inches
deep, which must be incompaffed with an iron-Ring
(xx), one Inch broad, and fastened at the Distance
of one Inch and a half from the upper Edge of the
Pot. Let a Segment (y) be likewise cut off the upper
Edge of this Pot, which Segment must be four Inches
and a half deep, and five Inches broad : The iron-
Ring just described must be bent all round the Edges
of this Segment. 12. Over against the Aperture
(tt) which communicates from the first Cavity (N0 7.)
into the second (N⁰ 10.) let another such Aperture (z)
be made two Inches distant from the Bottom of the
second Cavity (N0 10.) perfec‘tly like the foregoing
(gg tt), and communicating obliquely upwards
withathird Cavity (1 1 1 1), like, and equal to the
second-cylindrical Cavity (uzcuu) 3 that the-Fire

just mentioned (z), let a Chimney like the foregoing
(9999), and of the same Height (2 2 2 2) be
erefted, that may be shut with a Slider like that (3).
14. Finally, on the left Side of the third Cavity
(1 1 1 1) letan Aperture be made in the same Man-
