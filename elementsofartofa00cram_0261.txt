PROCESS X.

{⁷798 purifying of Silver by Laod, in a large Test, by the
Blast qf BellowS.

APPARATUS.

1. U T into a large Test made in an earthen Pot

P (Part Ι. Plat.1. Fig. ΙΙ.) and dried before-
hand in a warm Place, red burning Coals, till it is
thoroughly dry, and quite burning hot. Then make
a Hole in the Hearth of the Smith’s Forge, fit to re-
ceive the Pot with its Test, and fill it with Affles, to
such a Height as that the Border of the Test put into
it may be as high as the Hearth of the Forge. Place
the Pot in a horizonta] Situation, and fill the Space
between the Test and the Cavity of the Hole, with
Ashes well preffed down, lest they Ihould be eafily
blown away. Then dispose the Nosel of the Bel-
lows in such a Manner, that blowing obliquely down-
wards, it may play strongly upon the Cavity of the
Test t And this you will know to be well done, if
the Wind proceeding from thence, dissipates the
Ashes fallen in‘to the Test.

2. Put into the hollow of the Test, so much Straw‚
Paper, Linen‚ or worn out Cloth‚ as is neceffary to hin-
der the Surface of it frorn being damaged by the Silver
to be put into it : Fut your Silver thereupon, and cover
it well all over with red burning Coals: Thenexcite
the Fire with the Bellows, till the Silver melts: This
done, remove towards the Border the Coals hitherto
kept in the Middle of the Test. Add next some
new Wood and Coals, especially towards the Bellows;
and place the Coals all round in plenty, provided
they do not intercept the Sight of the Mass in fusion :
And mean while, continue to make a strong Fire
with the Blast of the Bellowa
