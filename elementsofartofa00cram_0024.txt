Case the whole Difference between the several kinds
of Suthm, would confist only in their various Mix-
ture with heterogeneous Matters. As therefore Nature
hardly affords any pure inflammable Matter‚ this is
not the place to treat of the several kinds of Sulphurs,
which are never without Mixture. Our Defign re-

quires, that we ffiould mention those only that are of
the fimpler kind.

malleable, not inflammable of the most fix’d Nature,

and perfectly coherent.

ticles, little or not at all coher‚ent they are called
Earths.

27. But when being vifible, palpstble‚ and extreme-
ly small, they nevertheless appear still minute Stones
heaped together, they are called Sand, Grmd, and
Grit.

28, Our Design chiefly requireS‚ that we should
shew- the Differences of Stones‚ resulting from their
differentChanges in the Fire: Nor will it be needless
to point out such of their other Charatsteristicks, as
are eafily apprehended by the SenseS.
