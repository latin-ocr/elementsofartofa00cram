AssAYING METALSj 425

of Air3 then, take out the Veffel ·‚ let it gtow cold,
and then break it. They endeavour to judge from
the Colour of the small Bits of Glas5‚ what Metal,
or metallick Earth, was contained in this Ort-:3 for
Instance‚ from the green Colour they conclude that
it contained Copper, from the greenish rusty, that
Iron, from the whitissi and mssky, that Tin, &db
and so on. If the Tinctum is not so senfible, the
Operation must be repeated with adding a greater

Qantity of the Ore.
The Use and Reasbns of the Process.

1. This Method of trying Ores has not yet been
made use of enough, so that one may conclude any
Thing certain from it. I shall boldly ἠγ, that in
’ most Cases you cannot with any Probability conjec-
ture what Metals lie hid in Minerals : And that
there is no thinking of the Qantity of them. The
following Observations render the Thing very diffi-
colt, and even makes one despair entirely, that ever
the Art ofrnaking Glass, as to the tinging them with
metallick Colours, will be brought to perfeetiom
and the Art of Affaying Metals be sufficient to that
Purpose. For first, the Colours of Metals,

* Precious Stones are supposed, in their natural State, to be origi·
nally of two Class'es, the Adamantine and the Crystalline3 if they
are found in their Matrix's untainted by any metalline Substame,
they remain pure Diamonds of the clearest finest Water, or Crystals
perfee‘cly transparent; but if a Diamond is tinged with Lead it
appears yellow; if with Copper and Iron, it becomes green, and if
with Cinnabar, it makes a most beautiful red, and then changes its
Name to a Ruby, and loses of its Hardness in Proportion to the
Mixture of the Metal with it: A Crystal tinged with Iron becomes
a Garnate3 with Copper and an Alkali, a Saphire 3 with Copper and
an aeid, an Emerald; with Lead, aTopaz and aJacinth; withGold, a
Chrysolite; with Copper and Iron, an‘Aquemarine, and so on in
many Varieties (See Woodward’s Method of Foffils, p. 23, and foll.)
and each of these latter may be imitated, by mixing Preparations of κ
Metals with the finest white flint-Glass, by which Method all Sorts
of Gems being counterfeited‚ are called Pastes, and are used to take
off Impteffions of antique Intaglia's and Cambo's.
