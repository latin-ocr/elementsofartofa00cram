374 The ΛΒΤ of

Fufion: And this seems to be the Cause why Graius
of Zink so difficultly run into one reguline Mass; be-
cause this Salt, while it absorbs the Phlogiston where-
with Zink is full, forms those small yellow Crusts

round the ‘Grains of the Zink, which Crusts are dif-
ficult to be melted.

The Use cmd Reasons of the Proccss.

1. The Reason is plain from this fingular Pro-
perty of Zink, why we try in vain, by Pre-
cipitation by Fufiou, with the Affistance of saline,
oily, reducing Fluxe3‚ to produce Zink from its Ores
hitherto known in Europe, in the same Manner as
we commonly use for other Metals and Semi-metaIS.
It is as plain, why it can much less be collected in
the Beds of the Furnaces (Proc. XXXIV), by a
Stratification with Charcoal‚ by Means of the Vitrifi-
cation of the terrestrial Bodies adherent to it, and of
a violent Fufion‚ excited with the Blast of Bellows ;
but ought rather to be collected and sublimed (Part 1.
§4o9. &c.) in Places pretty cold, and not much
exposed to the Affion of the Wind.

2. Mean while, the Zink that lies hidden in Ores,
or other compound fac‘titious Bodies‚ betrays its Pre-
sence by the Flowers which it emits from itself when
urged by a strong Fire‚ and by the golden citron-
Colour it gives to Copper. For both these Effech
were never produced by any other known Body, as
much as can be collected from all Experiments:
W'herefore, we may as surely conclude the Presence
of Zink from thern, as we surely conclude that of
Iron from the Aetion of the Magnet.

3. A strong open Fire, and a sublimatory Appa-
rmus (Part l. ᾗ 462), are required to⁷ colle& these
Flowers ε However‚ you must with great Care avoid
the too-violent Paffage of the Air through the Fur-
mee, and the least Blast of it through the sublima-
tory Pots : For the softest and lightest Flowers are

diffipated by the least Motion of the Air. ΤΙὲετὲ-
