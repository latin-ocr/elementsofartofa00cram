thought necessary, be filled either entirely or only in
part. Then with all Speed you put upon it the iron-
Cover (f), and strew the Border of this on the out-
fide, with Sand or Afhes, which you press gently with
your Hands: For if you should neglect this Point‚
all the Fuel contained in the Tower would be kindled,
and may endanger setting the House on Fire.

244. We shall here annex a few general Rules
concerning> the Regimen of the Fire in this Furnace:
For it is hardly necessary to explain all particulam,
since Praetice willeasily hint thern to such as shall be
ever so little acquainted with Chemistry. The Fire
may be made very strong, in the first Chamber
(Plat. IV. Fig. I. h h h h ii), when the Door of the
Ash-hole (c), and the Funnel (qq q q) of the Cham-
ber is quite open, and when the iron-Slider suspended
with Chains (6. p p) does not hinder the Fire from
paffing freely from the Tower into this Cavity. But
the closer the Funnel is shut, together with the Door
of the Ash-hole 3 the more the Violence of the Heat
diminishes: And this will be soon effected, if the
ison-Slider suspended with ChainS, is let down in part:
For the Fuel contained in the Tower‚ burns at least
as high as the Space between the lower Edge of the
iton—Slider and the Grate (d). Observe besides, in
those Operations, wherein the round Hole (l) of the
Door is stopt with a Plug (m), that when the strong-
est Fire is required, this Hole must not be kept long
open: Because the Air rushing violently through it,
soon cools the Bodies put into the Cavity. The Ope-
ration mentioned (ᾗ 243.) may be performed in the
second and third Chamber, in, and at the same Time,
and with the same Fire, as they are in the first Cham-
ber: For the F ire penetrates from the first Cavity
into the second, and increases, when the Funnel
(2 2 2 2) εῑεέὶεά on it is opened. But before you
do this, the Funnel of the first Cavity must be shut
as much as that of the second is opened. By the
same MeanS, you may hinder the Fire, which serves
for the Operations made in the two first Gavi-ties
