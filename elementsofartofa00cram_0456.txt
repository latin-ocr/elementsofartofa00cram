E-Lities broad: Let there be belides a small Hole at
.‘the Top of each Door, that one may conveniently
look into the Fornace.

The third Chamber built over this„ is perfec‘tly
like the two foregoing, except that the Arch is a few
Inches lower, and there is a quadrangulas Hole com-
municating from this Arch into the fourth Chamber‚
not in the Middle but towards one Side, and cut equi-
lateral, being four Inches square.

The fourth and last Chamber is arched, equal in
Breadth to the foregoffig, and only eight Inches high.
On the Side opposite to the Hole which from the
other Chamber communientes into this, at the Height
of two Inches above the Pavement, let there be a
cylindrical Funnel‚ made of an Iron-plate, and four
Inches in Diameter, which leads the Smoak and the
Flame into the Chimney of the Room. Let a Pas-

Pavement of the Chamber, opened in the Middle
of the Circumference, between the quadrangular
Hole and the Funnel. To which Aperture let an
Iron-door be hung, that the Veffels may be conveni-

Body to be changed, a Support higher than three
F inger's Breadth, if the Veffel is very large ·,
nor lower than one Finger's Breadth, if it ist very
small. But, if the Veffels are put at the Side, or

above the Fuel, as is most commonly donFein this
