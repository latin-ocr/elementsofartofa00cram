AssAYING METALS. 283

But if any Part of the Gold is still deficient, it lies
hidden in the Gramzla of the following Regulus.
Belides, it is no Rarity, to find some small Part of
the Gold in a Regulus that has been precipitated
three and even four Times, in such Manner, how-
ever, that the first is always richer in Gold than the
following. Now, this Granulation, which is not
less than five Carats of Gold in one Mark, may af-
terwards be easily separated by Aqua Fortis, after
having been previoussy purified in a Test (Proc.X1V.)
But if you have not yet such a Proportion, every
Granulation that contains such a smallQantity of Gold
as is worth the Charges of a Precipitation, must be
cemented together with Sulphur, according to ΝΟ, 2,
and the Gold must be again fetched out of it with
Part of the Silver, by a precipitating Flux, in the
Mannerjust described (ΝΟ. 3. &foll.) till thejust Pro-
portion is at last obtained.

6. The Silver remaining in the sulphureous Mix-
ture‚ is fetched out by Lead, or by iron-Filings, in
a large Test‚ or according to Ρνοσ. XVI.

1f you have neither the Opportunity nor the Time,
to separate from the Silver with Aqua Fortis, the
Gold which is sufficiently concentrated in the Regu-
lns’s ς the granulated Regulus may be cemented anew
with Sulphur (ΝΟ. 2.) to which you must add twice
as much of crude Antimony‚ and the Gold may be
fetched out by a precipitating Nux, in the Manner
above described. Thus the Gold will sink to the Bot-
tom‚ in the Room of the Silver, together with the
reguline Part of the Antimony. This done, you
must melt again several Times the Regulus with
fresh Antimonys that the Silver, which has at the
same Titne crept into the Regulus in a small Qan-
tity, may be separated: Finally, blow away the rc*
guline Part of the Antimony. See Proc. XXVII.
Nevertheless‚ if you ¹are not versed in these Opera-
tions‚ you can hardly perform this without some

small Loss of your Silver and Gold.
