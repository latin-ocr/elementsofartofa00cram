PROCESS II.

The Separation of Silver out of the Regulus, PrOC. Ι. b)
copelliug (Part I. ᾧ 454.)

T H E SeparatIOn of Silver out of Lead‚ when it
has been precipitated‚ and received by the
Lead, may indeed be intirely made by the Apparatus
of the foregoing Process as well as (Proc. I. Appar.
ΝΟ. 5). But this Method is tiresome, on account of
the lnconveniencies mentioned in the same Place:
Therefore, the Thing is better done by coppeiling.
But for this Reason a Seorification must precede 3 that
those Bodies‚ which greatly refist a sufficient Attenu-
ation to be effeeied by the Scoria of Lcad, may be
previoussy separated, and that the Addition of so
great a Qantity of Lead may not be necessary.

'APPARATUR

1. Put into the docimastical Furnace under the
Muffel‚ two Coppels of the same Bigness (Part I.
Plat. Ι. Fig. ΙΙΙ.) perfeffly dry, and of such Capa-
city‚ that they may contain a Regulus, at least one
third Part larges than that which is to be put into
them: Make a strong Fire‚ thatthey may be red
hot for a Qarter of an Hour, or more, and the
aqueous Vapours vanish intirely. Then free your
Regulus quite from Seoria’s, by several gentle Blows
ofa Hmnmer, wrap it up in a clean Paper, aud put
it into the Fire gemly with a Pair of Tongs ·, taking
great Care, that the hollow Surface of the Coppel be
not hurt: For which Reason, you must also take
Care, that this be not angular or rough. Now,
with a Ladle, put into the other Coppel as many
Centners of the same granulated Lead, which you
have used (Proc. foregoing) for the Scorification of
the Ore. All the Phenomena will appear the same
as we have described (Part I. § 38), and the Scoria’s
