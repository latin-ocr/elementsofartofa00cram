ASSAYING METALS. 2533

from Lime and all other Filthiness, pound them ῖηῖθ
an iron-Mortar‚ and then sift them through a course:ls
Sieve. Tak e four Parts of this Powde1·‚ and one
Ι artof Colcothar not washed‚ and of common Salt‚
mix them together, the more the better, ind grind
thern in the t³st1rne Manner, as if you would make
Spirit of S1lt. Moisten these Powders with a little
Water or Urine, so as that they may cohere when
preffed between your Hznds.

2. Take a clean earthen Veffel, quite found, suffi-
ciently thick, not ghzed, and of the requifite Size
(Part1.§218), strew the Bottom of it with your
moistened (ΝΟ. 1.) Powder, 01· Cement, and distri-
bute this every where with your F inger preffing it
down very gently, so that the Thickness of the Ce-

ὲ ment may be half an Inch all about. Put upon it
Gold extended 1n tliin PlateS, not thicker nor larger
than a golden Duckat‚ and rendered perfectly clean
by making thern a little red-hot in the Fire, so that
the Cement may he covered all over with them. Then
put a second Layer of Cernent after the foregoing
Manner 3 and likewise the same Plates of Gold upon
this as before, till the Pot is full to half an Inch dis-
tance from the Brim of it. Let this remaining Space.
be filled up with Cernent, · then at last cover the
Mouth of the Pot with a. Tne, and stop the Joints
close with Lute, lest the Spirits forced out by the
Fire should have the Liberty to get out.

Put this cementatory Pott> thus filled, into a
Furnace m which luch a Fire may be kindled for se-
veral Hours, as that the Veffels put into it may be
made red-hot in an equal Manner ε Such is the Atha-
νον described (Part Ι. Ρίαῖ. IV. Fzg. I), in which
'the Veffels may be placed under or without a Muffel,
in the Middle of the Coals, or in the first Chamber
At first, make a gentle Fire‚ and increase it succes-
fively, till the Pots grow middling red· hot, and not
rnore: For if you should use too great a Fire, your
Gold would mest, and again be in Part spoiled by

the same Things corroded off· by the ναροωέ οΓ the
emerit.
