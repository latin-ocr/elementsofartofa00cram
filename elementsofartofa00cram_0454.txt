428 The ΑΜ· of

the same Fire. I shall then describe this F umace, so
as that it rnay be eafily construcsted by any attentive
Reader : And for the clearer Understanding of this
Matter‚ Ihave given the Figure of it, to be seen at
the End of this Book.

For the Matter of it, chuse Stones that will bear
the strongest Fire. You will easily observe thiS, if
you use a Stone for the Support of a Crucible, in
which, for VInstance‚ a strong Fufion of Copper is
performed z If this Stone does not adhere to the Bot-
tom of the Crucible when it is taken out, nor looks
to be run to Glass ς except perhaps it has a very thin
vitreous Cmst, nor contradis Chinks, and preserves
its Hardness when grown cold, it is very fit for the
intended Use. You may instead of Cement use a
claycy ’ἓ Mamer, of which the same Stones‚ or
Bricks†‚ and the docimastical Furnaces are made. But
your Stones must be so fitly adapted to each other,
that the thinnest Stratum of Lute may be sufficient
to conglutinate them.

Let the Room in which it is to be construCted,
have a Funnel that gives a rapid Motion and Draught
to the Smoak : All the large Paffages opened to the
Air must be such as may be shut, and the Furnace be
made near this Chimney, in such a Place, as that the
Artificer may freely move round it.

The outward Figure of the Furnace rnay be cylin-
drical and arched at Top. Let the outward Diame·
ter be twenty four, or more Inches, according to the
Difference of the Stones ·, the Height must be forty
eight Inches : The Thickness of the wall, where it
is thinnest‚ must be four or fix Inches at least. The
inward Cavity is divided into four Chambers, which
are formed according to a parabolici< Line. The
lowermost serves for an Affi-h01e‚ and is twelve In-
ches high, and its greatest Diameter at Bottom four-
teen Inches. Whence the Description of the Para·
bola is sels—evident. Let this Arch be open at Top
