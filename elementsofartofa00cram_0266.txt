more to Lead than to Copper‚ fink to the Bottom in
Company with it; so that the Mixture is much richer
¹in Gold‚ Silver, and Lead there, than in the Middle,
and at the upper Surface. But if Sulphur and Arse-
nick are joined to the Mixtures of MetalS, they can·
not but make a great Alteration there ε For as they
both dissolve one Metal more greedily than another ·‚
they not only render the Mixture inequal, but some-
times destroy it intirely: So that a Metal diss'olved
by them, becoming lighter, it swims at Top like
Scoria’s, while the other Part of the Mixture finks
towards the Bottom‚ by its Gravity.

APPARATUS.

1. XVhen Ores grossy nidred, are colletsted into
brittle Regulus’s in the Beds of the ssim-aces, you are
to proceed in the lollowing Manner. With a Ham—
mer and a WVedgc, separate from the Regulus two
Pieccs of equal VVeight, forlnstance οἷ halfan Ounce 3
that is, one in the Middle of the upper Surffioe, be-
tween the Center and the Circumference3 and the
other in the inferior Surface ol* the Regulus, but on
the opposite Side. Beat both to a fine Powder, of
which weigh a Centner, and as Stilphun Arsenicl<‚
Iron, and a Portion of unmetallick Earth are not
wanting therein‚ proceed according to Proc. IV.

Bm when you have a Mind to examine a greater
Number of ngulus’s, together in one and the same
Triah cut off Bits from each Regulus, in the Manner
mentioned: You need only take Care5 that the
&Veights of the Eits cut off, be nearly proportioned
to the Weights of the Regulus’s .· Beat them all into a
fine Powder‚ and do the Rest as before.

2. But, When you are to examine Regulus's that
:ire not brittle 3 Bits must likewise be cut off, in the
Manner just (N0. 1.) mentioned ε But when cut, and
weighed exaffly, you must put them altogether into
a nex-v Crucible‚ well rubbed with Soap within, and

, melt them: When they are well melted‚ stir them

immediately
