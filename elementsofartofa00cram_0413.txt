oblong'Figure‚ four In'ches broad, and three Inches
high, *dextroussy applying to ic the acute Angle of
the Stone in such Manner³ that it may in all its Tra&
ingrave a deep Furrow in the Glass: This done,
touchevery Point of the said Furrow, with a strong
red-hot iron Wire: By this Meam, you will cut off
from the Cucurbite‚ a Piece ofGlass like the circum-
scribed Figure. Pur this Cucurbite under a Chimney
that carries smoke well, and in such a Situation, that
the Hole may be sorwards‚ and the Cucurbite in-
clined backwards a small Mamer, and pour into it
one or a few Ounces of warm VVater : Then intro-
duce a small shallow wide China-Vefl'el full of pure
Sulphur‚ through the Aperture made in the Belly of
the Cucurbite‚ and set this Sulphur on Fire with a.
Thread dipt in Brimstone: When the whole sax-0
face of it is on Fire·‚ put a Plate of Lead against
this Hole, that it may not admit more Air than is
neceffary to maintain the Flame. The aeid Spirit of
Sulphur will apply itself to the Sides of the Cucur-
bite‚ made moist by the warm Water, and, running
again to the Bottom‚ it will mix with the W'ater,
which being kept warm by the Coma& of the Veffel
in which the Sulphur burns, and spi-eading Vapours‚
disposes to a Condensation the aeid Spirits that are
expelled. But the Sulphur that is burning in a free
Air, commonly contracffs, at length, a small Crnst
arifing from the heterogeneous fixt Matters, some-
what hard, which hinders the Flame from sur-
ther consuming the Sulphur : Therefore this
Crust must be removed about every Qarter of an
Hour, if the Sulphur is not perfeffly pnre: Which
done the Flame is again revived. Nay‚ it is also ex-
tinguished by the Acid, which the half suffocated
weak Flame of the Sulphur has not been able to dis-
ripam, there remaining in the Surface of the Sulphnr
grown cold small Drops of a very aeid Nature. {f
you find that this is the Case, you must immediately
add fresh Sulphur‚ and admit a greater Qantity of
Air: Otherwise the Flame once extinguilliecl, is
