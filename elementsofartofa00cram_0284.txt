feffly well waffied: Otherwise you will not always
purify your Silver.

3. This Lunce Cornua, must be reduced the dry
VVay, that is, by whatever absorbs Aqua Regis with
great Force. Therefore you see this Property in
some Metals‚ for Instance, in Lead, Tin, and all the
alkaline fixt SaltS. But the Silver is spoiled anew by
the two former, and a great Qantity ofit is destroyed
at the same Time: Which may be gueffed from the
thick Smoak‚ which is produced in a violent Reduc-
tion made after this Manner. But all your Silver is
preserved by a fixt Alkaly, provided you use a proper
Course.

4. If you pour into the fixt Liquor remaining from
the Precipitation, aud decantem a fixt alkaline Li-
quor‚ or a volatile urinous concentrated Spirit‚ in
such Qantity as [hall greatly exceed the exact Point
of Saturation : The Colour of both, which was hard-
ly senfiblebefo1·e; turns to a deep Azuoe, which must
be owing to the Presence of Copper : For when thie
is in a small Qiantity, it diffolves the moist Way in
alkaline Stilts, and then produces this Colour. The
downy whitish Powder which is produced during this
Minore, and at first swims like Flocks of Wool‚
and then finks to the Bottom‚ is not Copper‚ bur
proceeds from the Eirrh, which is produced in every
Regeneration of neutra} Sahs, and to which the small
Qiantity of Gold which poffibly was in the Silver, is
n‘ilxt.
