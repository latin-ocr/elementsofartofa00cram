Section ; especially if there is any Lead in it. The
Scorification is made as in Proc. ΠΙ, but without
lead-Glass. Nevertheles3‚ if an imperfect and re-
fractory Scoria is produced, pour upon it a little of
¹ lead-Glass, to subdue it. Let the remaining Regulus
go through the Operation of coppelling, as in
Prec. ΙΙ. or, if there is any Copper, as in Proc. IV.

and prepared for a Trial : I-‘Iowever5 it is not always
'neceffary to begin by a Scorification3 unless Iron,
Tin, &a are mixt to the Mass : We have already
shewed the Manner of managing them.

4. When Coins are to be tried, you must cut off
a small Bit from them along your Diameter‚ and with
a File reduce it to the Weight of the Mark, in the
same Manner as the small Bit cut off from the Mass
of the Ingot.

5. But when Coins of different Kinds, and old
Utensils, that have been coloured by having been
boiled, are to be examined, the Thing is hardly
done with more Ease and Security‚ than if all these
Metals are granulated (Part 1. §216, 2 17.) together.

The 'Uft ancl Reasons of the Process.

1. There is almost a greater Care required, in the
Choice of these Specimens‚ than in the Operation it-
self‚ by which Gold and Silver are separated from the
other Minerals. Great Errors may be committed,
when an Ingot is to be melted out of the small Masses
cut off. For Sulphur, Arsenick, Copper, Lead,
and all the other Miuerals, evaporate in Part, when

the Fire ‘is too strong and too long kept, and partly ’

turn to Scoria's‚ while the more fixt Part of the Sil·
ver and Gold does remain: For this ReasOn, the
Proportion which ought to have been preserved in
the remaining Ingot, is taken away ε Whence it hap-
