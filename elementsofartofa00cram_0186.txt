16ss The ART of

417. We have hitherto found but two Metals in
the mineral Kingdom, that are naturally diffolved by
this Acid of Srdphur, viz* Iron and Copper. There-
fore, they reckon only two native Virriols, viz. that
of Iron, and that of Copper. The former, which is
green, semi-diaphanous‚ consisting of rhomboidal
Crystals, and of a swcet, astringent, styptick Taste,
melts first in the Fire‚ and casts out an aqueous Va-.
pour, and then dries up, and turns into a grey Pow-
der, which, by increasmg the Fire, at last becomes
ofa reddish Colour 3 while at the same Time Μ’ acid
suffocating (ξ 22.) Vapour is expelled out of it. But
the Vitriol of Copper, when artfully separated from
the foregoing„ and rendered pure, is blue, less trans-
parent and aqueous‚ more ponderous‚ not melting so
easlly in the Fire, of a very unpleafitiit‚ caustick
Taste3 and otherwise not very different from the
other. Both these Vitriols difl'olved in Writer, im·
part to it their own Colours.

418. These two Vitriols most commonly are found
joined together ·‚ just as the two Met-als out of which
they are extraeTcd when the said Metals have been
dissolved by the Acid of Sulphur, are hardly ever
found solitar-y, but are most commonly mixt with
each other in many different ProportionS. In the
mean Time, the Vitriol oflron is very predominant
in these concrete Bodies. It is an easy Matter' to find
’ out, whether there is any Copper in any Vitriol, if
you put a well polished Plate ofIron into the Solution
of Vitriol : lor then there is always some Copper
driven out, which applies itsels immediately to the
Surfaceof the Plate, under the Form of a very fine red
Powder. But, whether, o'r in what subterraneous
Places, the Vitriol of Copper may be found as pure
as the blue Vitriol we buy, lindeetl know not. That
Vitriol seems rather to be artificiah which is sold
under the Name of Roman Vizrid, Cypriam Vitriol,
