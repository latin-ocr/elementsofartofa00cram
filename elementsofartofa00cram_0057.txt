undergo the above-mentioned Accident83 but their
Surfaces being so far encreased, Copper and Iron turn
entirely into Scoriae and are destroyed, and Tin and
Lead are so in great Part. It is therefore very detri-
mental when these viler Metals are mix'd in ever so
small a Qantity with Gold and Silver. For in the
melting there come upon the Surfaces light Scoriae, in
which the Gold and .Siver is retained as in Spunges,
and is hindered from running into the Regulus. To re-
move these Inconveniences, Borax is added, because
as it helps the melting of MetalS‚ and of all Bodies by
F ire, its bringing the whole Mass to a quick F us10n,
causes the Metals to fink to the Bottorn without Loss,
and vitrifies the lightest Scorz'oe, throwing thern on the
Surface. Which is true of both the nobler an'd the
viler Metals, but of Copper and Iron especially. Be-
fides, Borax, by covering the Surface of Metal tor-
tured in the Fire, as if it were with a kind of very
thin Glass, defends it against the combined Force of
the Fire and Air, which is very destruetive of imper-
fest Metals especially ς belides, that it also causes
Metals to melt in a much less Fire.

134. It is likewise expedient to rub with Borax the
Inside of the Crucibles in which the more precious
Metals are to be melted: For they, bythat Means,

are totally covered with a thin vitreous Crust, when ⁸

in Fusion, and the small Cavities which never fail to
render the Inside of even the best CrucibleS, uneven,
are filled up : So that the Metal may be poured out
all very neatly. Therefore, it is a chief Point never
to neglect this particular, when any little Mass of
Gold or Silver is to be melted a second Time.

13 5. Observe however, that, if you melt Gold
with Borax, you must add to it a little Nitre, or Sala
Ammonias, but not both together ς because they
would make a Detonation. For Borax alone makes
Gold pale ; but it recovers its Colour again, by means
of Nitre‚ or of Salt Ammonias.

136. Borax, on account of the above-mtntianed
Qality (ξ 133.) is classed‚ though improperly, a·
