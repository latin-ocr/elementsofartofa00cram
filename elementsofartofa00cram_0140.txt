Fertis, or Aqua Regis 1s poured upon them·, that you
may thus be certain, that there is no Fraud at Bot

tom: otherwise, you are not to doubt upon any Ac

count, your being deceived by a false Colour. 3. All
Gold rendered brittle‚ when compared with the Needle
upon the Touch-stone, appears less pure, than it is
indeed found to be, by an accurate docimastic al Exa-

mination: and on the contrary, all Silver rendered
brittle, has the Whiteness of pure Silver m a higher
Degree. Nor is it difficult to find out the Reason of
this Difference. sor the Bodies which make Silver or
Gold brittle, are only a few Metals and Semi-metals,
all of a very bright white Colour : such as Tin, Lead,
Iron, Regulus ofAntimony, Bffnuffl, Zink, and Arsem'ck.
Now these dilate the yellow Colour of Copper and
Gom, or change it into wnire: so that the Colour of
the Copper mixt with Silver 1s then hidden·‚ whereas
Gold on account of these Minores, appe ars to have a
great Deal of Silx er in it 4. In a white Allay Aqua
Fortis does not discover (ξ 302.) the Presence os Sil-

ver‚ from twenty three to seven Carats (ᾗ 295),
because Aqua Fortis does not separate Silver from Gold,
unless the Mass contains three times more Silver than
Gold. 5. Metallick Streak s or Crusts which have
been imprinted a while upon the Touch· stone, can

not be compared with fresh ones: sor their remain-

ing long upon it, commonly occafions an Alteration
in the Colour. 6 Silver, when tempered with BJ-,ass

appears whiter‚ than it would, if mixt with a like
Qantity os Copper: but as it may then be rendered
suffic iently duffii by a proper Operation‚ · you will
hardly be able to find out the Fraud with the Touch-

stone, unless you make a second Time the Compa-
rison with a Needle of the same Colour, having
previoussy poured Aqua Regis (ᾗ 302 ) upon the
metallick Crust, laid by rubbing on the Touch stone.

Nor are the Touch Needles tempered with Brass‚ of
any great Use here3 because this artificia] Metal is
sometimes more, sometimes less yellow. 7 If the

Metal applied upon the Touch· stone by mbbjjng'
