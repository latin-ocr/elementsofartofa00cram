but a very small Quantity that can be thus diffolved,
a certain one cannot be universally determined‚ smce
it must be found out by a very gentle Distillation‚ in
Experiments made on purpose. The other Part of
the diffolved Metal runs freely with the Mercury .-
But if the Amalgama is strained through a Glove-
leather Purse‚ the Metal is retained in it, imperfectly
diffolved‚ together with about an equal Qantity
of Jlffercury adhering.

(ξ ι7.) well pounded and mix’d together with several
Earths‚ especially with such as are calcareous and not
to beaffeeted by the F ire, being exposed to the F ire,
proves much more fixt than it is of itself.

70. If to the Mixture (§ 69.) is added a little ‘Tar-
ίαν, and it be then lightly moistened with Water, and
pressed down with small Plates of Iron interposed
every where, in aVeffel able to resist the greatest F ire ;
and if finally, the Veffel being well closed with only
a small Aperture left to it, is exposed for {ix or eight
Hours, first to a moderate F ire cncreased at last to the
highest Degree, so that the Mass within may be melt-
ed·, the whole prov es a white brittle Regulus of Iron,
not to be reduced to its former State, except by an
open Fire, continued very long.

71. Ifcopper1s managed m othe same manner with
Arsenick, it acquires the same whitenesS, and retains
in good part its Malleability: Especially, if lt is once
or twice melted with Tartar and Borax, that the su-
perfluous Arsenick still inherent may be diffipated.

mediately to A,ihes the Part of the Arsenick adhering

strongly enough to the Tin.
