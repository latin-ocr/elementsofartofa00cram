scorifying, but also of aprecipitating Nature, since
it absorb‘s Sulphur and Arsenick ε For a Scorification
may be performed by the lead-Ore, or its Scoria‚ and
by adding other Fluxes: But the greatest Part of the
Lead is retained in the Smria's, together with the
metallici< Part inherent in the Ores, when a Pyrites
containing Iron is wanting: Nay, Lead itself‚ can-
not be sufficiendy, and sometimes not at all precipi-
tated out of its Ore, and rendered pure, without the
Affistance of Iron. (3.) A too great Qantity of Ar-
senick is hurtful here, and for the most Part hardly re-
ducible into Glass, on Account of its Rapaciousness‚
and of the Destruftion ofthe Lead (Part I. §7 3.) But
a great Deal of the Arsenick is also fixt with metal-
lick and unmetallick Earths‚ and is mixt with both
of thern z VVhence very coarse Regulus's are produced ς
the Scoria’s‚ on the contrary, retain a great Deal of
the Metal: Thence are also produced semi-arse-
nical Substances, that are distinet from the Scoria's
and the Regulus, containing chiefly Copper and Iron ;
which are called by the German Metallurgists {aava
fetssleg, when they contain a great Qantity of Cop-
per with Ir0n; but are called &peste by the same,
when they conlist only of Iron and Arsenick : These
have much of the unmetallick Earth in them:
