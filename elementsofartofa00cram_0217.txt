Arm, wherein the 1< nowledoe of the Mixture or
Pureness of Minerals, as well as t:the Purifying of them,
or the several Compofitions thereos, are required.
For this Reason‚ its Usefulness is very great, chie θ),
in that Part of Phyfick called the Mztericz Medic εἲ,
Because there are a great many Minerals made use or
in Medicines: Theresore‚ a Phyfician must know
them, as so many Instruments of his Art : Unless he
will run an equal Charace, of either hutting or doing
Good, or even of doing nothing at all. &This wiu

docimastical Examination, before they are received

into the Shops of Apothecaries.

than to pretend to bring Metals to a greater Degree

Qacks and Boasters very frequently spend great =
Riches about the most trifling Operations.

Art of making Glass When any, for Instance‚ has
a Mind to make Glaffes of the Colour of Jewels †.
