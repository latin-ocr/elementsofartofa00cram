be found in AutliorS. The Ores that yield Zink, are
by a long and several Times repeated Roasting, freed
from Sulphur, and in a Manner from Arsenick by
the same Operation. When laid into Strata (ᾗ 240.)
with Coals‚ they next are put into prismatical, qua-
drangular fornaces, the Height of which is several
Times greater than their Breadrh and Length. Three
of the Sides of every such Furnace, are so many
thick Walls ·, but the fourth, which is in From, is
shut up close with Plates, cut out of a kind os Stone
easy to be clest, and hardly above one Inch and a half
thick. There is another Plate made of the fiune
Stone, applied within to the inserior Border os the
lowerrnost of these Plates, and placed in such Man-
ner, that rising up obliquely and inwardly from the
said Border, it makes a Channel declining towards
either Side of the Furnace‚ ending in a Hole left
in that Part of the Furnace, and designet! to carry
thence into this Hole, whatever falls into its Cavity.
If then the Ores (ᾗ 409.) melt in a great Fue, ex-
cited with Bellows, placed below the back-Part of
the Furnaces 3 at the same Time the Zink, which is
altogether volatile, applies itself Drop by Drop to
the just described thin‚ sommost, and always less
hot Wall of the Furnace, and very much likewise to
the Joints of the stony Plates of which it is made;
because these J(›ints form Chinks and Furrows that
are inequal. In this Cale, if the said sereniost Wail
of the Furnace is struck lightly many times over,
during the Fufion, the Zink flowing down Drop by
Drop‚ falls into the hollow Channcl just described,
and is, by its Declivity, determined to run towards
the small Hole which is at the End of this Channel,
and thence to fall and gather into a small Veffel put
under it. Nevertheless, a very great Part of the
Zink is burnt and diffipated during this Operation ς
which is also evidenced a Priori, by the easy Com-
bustibility of Zink in a much milder Fire3 and
chiefly by the beautiful green Colour of the Flame‚

that rushes out of the Furnaces at that Time, and by
