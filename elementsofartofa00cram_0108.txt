This Plate likewise is fastened with two Bolts (n n);
to be put horizontally with the ison-Hooks (ο 0 0 ο),
driven into the Wall near the Edge of the Aperture,
so that one Bolt may fasten the upper Part of the
Plate, and the other the lower. 8. It is moreover
proper, that the square Aperture (g g), through
which the Fire enters from the Tower into the Cavity
hitherto described (N0 7.) may be {hut and opened
at Pleasure with an ison-Slider: For if this is not
done, an exceffive Fire, employed sometimes by an
unexperienced Hand, cannot be so enfily checked.
For this Purpose, leta Slit halfan Inch broad, and
eleven Inches long, be left in the Wall that consti-
tutes the upper Part of the Cavity (N0 7), and is con·

on every Side, and reach before and behind into the
small Groove, going down along the perpendicular
Sides of the said Aperture (gg), and retain the
iron-Slider to be put into it to keep it steddy. How-
ever, let this i1·on-Slider (6) be fix Lines thick, eleven
Inches broad, and five Inches high ·, and let a Couple
of small iton-Charine. (p p) be fastened on each Side of
its upper Edge, wherewith the Slider may be lifted
up and let down again. Therefore, let a Conple of
strong iron-Nails ἢ be drove into the contiguous Wall
of the Tower, perpendicularly over those Places, in
which the said small Chains are fastened to the iron-
Slider, that any of the Links of the Chains may be
suspended on them at Pleasure. Moreover, let the
upper Edge of the Slit above described be entirely
shut up with Stones and Cement, leaving only two
small Holes through which the small Chains may be
paffed. 9. On the left of this (N0 7.) Cavity, and
at the Distance of eight Inches from the Bottom ofit,
let a square (q q q q) Chimney or Funnel be erected

with Bricks‚ three lnches and a half in the clear, ·

four Foot high, and a small Matter convergent up-
wards, so that the Di.1rneter of it at Top may be

three Inches. This Funnel must be contrived 131] be
