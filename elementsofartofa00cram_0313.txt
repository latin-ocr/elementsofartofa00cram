by which common crackling Salt is not regenerated‚
is an Objeftion to this. The ammoniacal Sub-
stance which proceeds from the Acid of common
Sam &a and from volatile Anzan, also detonates with
Nitre: But if you take this for the Cause of the
Detonation‚ the. first Experiment is repugnant to it,
by which fulminating Gold, having exastly the same
Effest, has been produced by fixt Alkali: Nor does
the Inclufion of decrepitating or detonating Salts in
the compa& Body of the G01d‚ produce the Violence
of the Fulmination ε For if fulminating Gold is long
boiled in Water‚ this its violent Strength perissaes,
and the major Part of the Salts may be walhed off:
Which could never be done, if they were inclosed
in the Particles of the Gold‚ as in so many Veffels
that ssuould retain and iniprison them. Therefore‚
the Explanation of this Point must still be fetched
out of Democritus’s Well.

OF LEAD.

PROCESS XXX.

T 0 reduce and precipitate Lead out cf a faſsble Ore.
(Part I. §456‚ 466.)

APPARATUS.

1. EAT your Ore into a coarse Powder‚ just

B like the Graius of coarse Sand: Weigh of
this Powder two docimastical CentnerS, and put
thern into a Test. Put upon this a Tile or another
Test: But you must spread the comniinuted Ore as
wide as poffible in the Test : Roast it next, fix-st in a
gentle Fire‚ which must be gradually increased‚ till
the Veffel is almost red hot : leave it thus for a few ,
Minutes: then take off the Tile: and in a short
Time the blackissi Colour of the Ore will become of
a yellowish alh-Colour ε Which shews that the Sul-
phur is diffipated at least sor the greatest Part.

2. Beat the roasted Ore intoa subtil Pons-cler, and
add twice as much of the black Plus: (Pars Ι. ᾗ 162),
