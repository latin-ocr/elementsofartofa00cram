Pur-nace‚ that they may be exposed to a strong Hc'a't:
and to a very quick Flame, you are to chuse larges
Pieces os Wood and Charcoal. Now, if you open
in the Wall of the Roorn, a Hole somewhat larges
or at least equal to that which is at the Bottom of the
Ass1·hole, and make a Pipe or Trunk of iton-Plates
leading from the former into the latter, and on the
other Hand shutting the Room very close all round,
that the Ait may not rush in too freely3 then, the
Blast of Air that paffes through this Twnk, is the
stronger, as the Chimney of the Room grows the
warmer: Whence the greatest Degree of Fire pro-
duced by a Draught of Air, is at last obtained. But
the Fire will be of the utmost Strength at the small
Doors of the second Chamben so that a few Ounces
of Copper being flung without any Addition into a
Crucible that is red-hot there, will melt in a Mi-
nute‚ being agitated by a Fire greater than is neces-
sary for the pouring of Copper into a Mould‚ to re-
present any certain Figure. The Veffels are put in
through the small Doors, and are put upon the Mar-
gin, whereon the iton-Burs which form the Grate, are
placed. You may place as many Veffels round the
Circumference of the Chamber as there are Doors in
it. The Veffels Which are put in, before the Fur-
nace is persec‘tly warm, may be put upon a low
Support‚ made of a Stone one Inch thick, and not
easy to be vitrified. You may see and try the Mat-
ter in the Veffels‚ through the small Hole made in
each of the Doors that are hung on Hinges. In the
third Chamber‚ you may, on Account of its Pave-
ment’s being much broader', put a double Row of
Veffels therein‚ that is, twelve in Number, or more,
if they are of a middling Size. The Fire is milder
in this Chamber than in the foregoing, viz. a mid-
dling melting Fire. F inally‚ the F ire is much more
gentle in the fourth and uppermost Chamber, and is
of very great Use for Calcinations and Roastings, to
be made in a middling Fire: But then, indeed, the
Yefl'els do but grow red-hot there. If you ὴεινεὲ
