of the Beam may be put into two Holes (cz cz) made
for that Purpose at the Ends of the LegS‚ orbe taken
away from them. Let a very ssiarp Needle (c) be
'fixed m the Head of the Fork, stmding perpendicu-
larly downwards, if the Fork, 33 suspended, and so
long, as that it may almost touch the Top of the
Tongue of the Beam <Plat.V.Fz·g.11.c) put into
the Fork, when in equilibris] This Needle is the
Mark ·of the Equilibrium· ‚ and thatthe Amisi, who
stands over-against it, may be able to observe this,
the Legs ofthe Fork most be broader in that Place,
and have an Opening ¹two or three Lines (d) wide.
However, this Fork may be adorned at ’Pleafure .;
provided the Motion of the Balance is not hindered
„by such Ornaments, Then take two Scaies made ofa,
thin Blate of Silver‚ almost fin, one Inch and a half
in Diameter‚ hangingon three small silk-Strings‚ al-
most as long as the Beam, tied together at Top with
a Silver Hook, in Form of an S, and hang them to
‚the Extremities of the Beam. A [ιη-3116( * silves-Diffi,
somewhat less than one Inch in Diameter‚ belongs to
each of these scales (Fzg. V), You first put into
theseDishes, with ,3 Pais of Pincers, the Rodies to 136
weighed, or with a Spoon or a small Shovel, when
they are pounded, and then you put them into the
,Scales z The-refore, the small Dishes <must be perfeffly
equal in Weight. We use them, that Bodies may be
more conveniently put into and taken out of the
ScaleS‚ and that these, which are vastly thin, may
not be bent, soiled, and so be rendered false by wip-
