little larger, may be put upon it with equa] Security.
Ther-(fore, let the Feet of it be spread wide asunder,
tzhzt some lighted Coals may eafily be put under 01
taken away, and all the Appearances of the Solution
be ca refully examined

211. Next to this, we use a Copper Skellet or
Glass Bowl (Plat. II. Fig. XIII.) furnished with an
Handle and a Nib, for the washing clean of the
Calx of Silver precipitated by Copper out of Aqua

· Fortis. It 13 the better when made of Copper‚ because

it then can expel whatever Qantity of Silver--remains
in the Solution after the precipitation. For there
remains almost always something of it. The Diame-
ter of this Veffel must be fix Inches or more, its
Depth about four Inches.

212. You must furthermore have at hand a small
golden Dish, one Inch broad, and halfan Inch deep,
(Plat. II. Fzg. XIV.) which serves to heat the Gold
in red hot, from which another Metal has been eroded
in a docimastical Operation 3 that any remains of
the 1W872struum still adhering to it may be diffipated.
It must be made of the purest Gom.- For in an
Earthen Dish, grown porous and brittle by the Sepa-
ration, part of the Gold might be scraped off: And
if it were made of another Metal, it would either
melt, not being able to refist so great a Fue, or cast
scaly Scorias, or even be corroded by the Metstrzmm
remaining in the Gold ; and thus would both waysdi-
1111111111 the weight 01 f the Gold, and deceive theAssIryer.

213. You must likewise have a ρ1111101111ῑ 11101
Trivet (Plat. ΙΙ. Fzg. XV) adapte d to this Dish
(§ 212), to support it.

214. The washing· Trough 01· Tray <Sinda [ιι-111,
toria, Plat. ΙΙ. Fzg. XVI.) is an ohIong VcssLI, 111
which the lighter and unprofitable Purts of the Ure-9,
are washed off, by pom-ing ‘Water upon thern and
. stirring it. It must be made of Eam-xlv 01· of Smne,
not glazed, though ofa clean 111100111 Smfi ’·e. Hm!-
ever, any ot her Veffel of a 111111111911ΗΕ pret ity, and
pretty wide, may serve for 1110111, eUse.
