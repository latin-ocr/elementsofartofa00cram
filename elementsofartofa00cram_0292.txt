made them red· hot again, put a small [212oe of each
Portion severally into two imall separatory Cucur-

ssowly, you may put a small bui-nian Coal under the
Trivet. As for the rest, perform the Diffolution ac-
cording to Proc. XXII.

However‚ take Care, mean while, lest the smal‘l
Cucurbite be shakm, whereby the small brittle Plates
of the remaining Gold, which had hitherto preserved
their Figure perii-Gk, might break asunder, or any
Thing of this Substanoe be rubbed off. Having then
decant-ed the DUTohnion, invert the Cucurbites gent-

of every one of them into the golden Dish put under-
neith.

which all the Assies which may have fallen into it,
must have been blown first with a Pair of hand-Bel-

last grow moderately red-hot within a Qarter of an
Hour: This small Plate thus heated being grown
cold, put it in a good Balance, to weigh it.

Mamer, and put it in the other moveable Scale to
