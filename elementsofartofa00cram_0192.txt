429. There are in several Countries Mines enfily
come at, out of which the purest, native, common
Salt (ᾗ 20.) is gotten in a solid Form : it is called
Sal Gem, or Rode-salt. This Salt: is perfeftly pure,
white, half-tnansparent‚ and different from the other
common Salt‚ by its large, compast, and apparently
homogeneous CrystalS, which larger Crystals pro-
duced by Art, are a Colleffion of many smaller Ones:
It is much more permament in the common Air, nor
does it contra& a Moisture so soon as the vulgar
Kind of Salt. But these so very pure Pieces of Sal
Gem are not found in so great Plenty3 but, as one
may eafily guest, they are now and then infe&ed with
other compound Minerals that mix with them. But,
when these foreign Bodies are mixt with the Salt in
large Qantities‚ it is freed of them, by diffolving it
in Water‚ letting it settle, and then straining it 3 and
finally, by evaporating the Brine (for that is the
Name of the Solution of it in Water), the Salt is
again restored to its solid Form. But then it is no
longer styled Sal Gem ³¹⁶. “ Ρ

430. The whole Oeean, and the several mediter-⁷
ranean SeaS‚ (or larger Lakes) are full of common
Salt: Nevertheless, the Waters of thern all are not
equally saturated with it. Some, in one ¹Pound of
Water, will have above an Ounce of Salt diffolved ;
and some others hardly halfan Ounce, and even less.
Above all, the Seas that lie under and about the tor-
rid Zone, are more full of Salt‚ than the icy Seas
towards the North. The Salt‚ which is fetched out
of them, either by the bare Evaporation in the Sun
