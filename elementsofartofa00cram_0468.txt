with Glaffes are tinged‚ require a Variety of Mem.
strua, according to the Variety of the Metals.

The Calcination ofIron and Copper is performed al-
most by the same Things, the principal ofwhich are z
1. Fire alone, which destroys the Metals called im-
perfeft, and even Iron itself very easily without
sticking, and Copper more easily still ι This is done

in a mort Time, if you reduce those Metals to thin ⁴

Plates, or to Fiiings‚ and put them in a Veffel co-
vered with a Tne, into the third Chmnber, where
they are left, till they become perfec'tly triturable.
When triturated‚ let them be calcined once or twice
over for halfa Day or more, that all the small
Maffes which poffibly have preserved their metallici<
State, may be burnt. Let the Fire never be so strong,
as that the Calx may have any Dispofition to a State
of Fusion. 2. Let the pulverized Sulphur mixt with
Iron-filings, be exposed for a few Hours to a strong
Fire, in a covered Crucible‚ in the third Chamber.
Let the Filings be corroded, that they may become
triturable, and the triturated Calx be roasted for one ·
or two Days in the fourth Chamber. lt will thus
‘turn to Colcothar of a dark red Colour, fit to tinge
Glaffes. This Aetion of Sulphur is still quicker upon
Copper than upon Iron: For pretty thick Plates of
the former stratified with pulverized Sulphur in a
close Crucible‚ being exposed to a middling Fire in
the third Chamher‚ are penetrated in a few Hours,
and rendered brittle‚ much thicker‚ and of a clark
Colour ·, and when pulverized afterwards, put into
the fourth Chamber in an open Veffel, they are
rortsted for a few Hours‚ that the remaining Sulphur
may be diflipated. Thus you will have Calx of Cop-
per p‘repared with Sulphur. 3. Oil of Vitriol diluted
with *Writen quickly diffolves Iron, and turns to Vi·
triol together with it ε Α small Quantity of Copper is
more difficultly diffolved by it (See Proc. LXXIII).
The Crystals of Vitriol made by Evaporation, being s

dried over a warni Ovem, fall into Powder, which ,γ

must again be toalled in the fourth Chamben edul-

corated η
