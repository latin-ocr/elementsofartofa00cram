of the Alimbeck, and thence run down through its
Neck into the Recipient applied to it. Let the Dis-
tillation be performed in a gentle Fire for a few Days:
The Vinegar saturated with Lead and dulcified, will
be collected in the Recipient. Being inspiffated ac·
cording to Art it forms a Heap of Crystals called
Saccharum Saturni, Sugar of Lead .- These being
calcined in a gentle Fire, fall into a white Powder,
which is very useful for GlasseS. Calx of Lead made
red in an open reverbatory F ire, and called red-Lead,
or the Litharge commonly sold, may be substituted
for the foregoing. But, as the latter in particular,
commonly leaves the Regulus of Lead at the Bottom
of the Veffel ς it must be melted, before it is added
to the Mixture sor the making of Glass, and then
poured into the inelting Cone, and the precipitatech
Regulus of Lead must be separated, or the Mixture
prepared for Glass be poured into Water, if it has
been only a Quarter of an Hour in Fufion 3 and the

Therefore, it is also proper, to mix with those Glaffe's
to which Litharge or any other Calx of Lead is
added, a Portion of Nitre, which destroys the Lead,
and vitrifies it soon. For Litharge confists of very
subtil Scales, and of small Maffe‘s of Lead outwardly

Tin is still inore easily calcined than Lead by the
first Method, and with a stronger Fire ·, otherwise,
it is sooner prepared by the following Method in par-
ticular. WVhen your Tin has been melted in a Cru-
cible by a gentle Fire, add to it half as much Lead:
This done, increase the Fire by degrees. So soon as it
{regins to grow red, the Tin is rejected out of the Mix-
rure, in form of a Calx of differentColours. Conti-
