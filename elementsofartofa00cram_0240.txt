The ΛΚΤ of

The Ufi’ and Reasons of the Process.

1. When you are chufing a Coppel you must
have Regard to the Capacity of it·‚ for Instance,
whether it answers the Qantity of Metal to be put
into it, or no. Too large a Size1s no way detri-
mental‚ but only useless. Whereas, if it is too small,
the Operation does not succeed well. For =if the
Coppel is loaded with too much Lead‚ the Infide of
it is at last corroded and split, by the Litharge into
which the Leacl is dissolved‚ and which finally con-
sumes every T hing. · Nay‚1fthe Alhes of the Cop-
pel are already saturated‚ a greater Qantity of the
Litharge cannot get into it so quickly‚ and that Par t

of it, which ιε then absorbecl‚ runs through upon the
'Bottom ofthe Mustel: Which hes this Inconvenience,
that when the said Bottom being corroded grows in-
equal, the Vess'els put into it do not afterwards stand
steddy, and are conglutinated to it, if the Heat is
confiderably increased.

2. The Coppels‚ though extrearnly old, and to
Appearance very dry, like many other Bodies‚ being
nevertheless exposed to a strong Fire, exhale a rnoist
Vapom, as we learn from chemical Distillations:
But above all, the Alhes of Wood do not easily part
with the Moisture they have once contracted, because
of the Salt from which they can hardly be intirely
freed. Thmefore, those Coppels chiefly which are in
part composed of W'ood·assaes, must previoussy be
made thoroughly red—hot under the Muffel, without
any Lead put into thern, that all the Moisture may
be diffipated. This roasting is called in German
fibatbuen. But if this is not done sufficiendy, the
Lead put too soon into the Fire, flings to the very
Cieling of the Muffel, an innumerable Qantity of
small Drops like ΞρῑιτΗεε, with a gentle crackling ·
Noile. Anla as this Lead has 1n ita proportionable
ant ity or Silver, it renders the Process uncertain.
