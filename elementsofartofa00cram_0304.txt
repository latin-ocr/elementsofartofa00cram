Duffility, unless it is afterwards melted with Nitre
and Borax (Ρνοε. XXI), or intirely corroded by the
Cement which remained from the Antimony.

4. As then the Sulphur of Antimony takes away
the menstrua] F orce between the Gold, the Copper,
and the Silver·‚ and the reguline Part does but help
the Precipitation 3 it is easy to find out, why itis not
proper to precipitate Gold from the other Meta18‚
with only Antiniony‚ and that some more Sulphur
must still be added. For unless this be done, a
greater Qantity of crude Antimony is required, for
the supplying of a sufficient Quantity of Sulphur:
But then in this case so much Regulus is precipi-
tated out os it, and joined to the Gold, that you
cannot diffipate it without Loss of your Time, La·
bour, and Gold : For this Regulus is very rapacious,
nor does it altogether spare your Gold.

5. Such Gold, that is well purified by crude An-
timony, is indeed so pure, that being compared
with the purest Gold (Proc. XXI.) on the Touch,
stone, its pale Colour‚ proceeding from the Silver,
is not eafily perceived3 but if the very same Gold
is diffolved, according to Proc. XXI, by Aqua
Regis, there appears nevertheless something of the
Silver.

6. As the Sulphur of Antimony has in it the Sil-
ver separated from the Gold, this may again be pre-

cipitated outof it, according to Proc.XVl: But then a

at the same Time the remaining reguline Part of the
Antimony smks to the Bottom together with the Sil-
ver. Let then aSpecimen be separated from this
Mixture‚ and examined by Scorification (Proc. I.)
and by Coppelling (Proc. ΙΙ) ·, this done let the Re-‘
sidue of the Silver be put into Aqua Fortis, to know
whether there remained any Gold joined with the
Silver (Proc. XXII), and how much, if any: Which
may afterwards be intirely precipitated, according
to Proc. XXVIII, if it will pay the Charges. But the
Antimony which is melted with the Gold already
pure, as likewise that which is at three or four- diffe-

rent
