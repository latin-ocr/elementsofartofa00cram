ASSAYING METALS. 361

moderate Hem, and diffolve it·‚ while they leave the
Sulphur untouched : When the Solutions decanted
are precipitated by a Solution of fixt alcaline Salt,
and ecIulcorated, they produce the Calx of Anti-
mony ; which is nothing else but the intire Regulus
dissolved by the Acids.

PROCESS LXII.

The Reduffi‘iou of the Calx’s of Autimony (Proc. LXI.)
into cz semi-metallick Regulus.

APPARATUS.

IX some Calx of this Kind with a quarter Part

of the black Flux‚ and put it into a Crucible 3

cover the Veffel'with a Tile ς make the F ire as quick-
ly as the Veffels can bear it, but not greater than is
neceffary to rneIt the F lux itself : When the whole
has been well in F ufion for half a Qarter of an Hour
(which may be tried with a Tobacco-pipe taking off
the Tile) pour it into the melting Cone, which must
be warm and done over with Tallow : Then imme-
diately strike the Cone several Times : When you
have inverted the Cone, and shaken out the Matter
grown cold in it, you will find at the Point a Regulus
like (Part Ι. ᾗ 77), and at the Bafis a saline Scoria.
· If you have a Minci to reduce or try a small Qantity
of it, you must do it either upon a Charcoal with
- the cementatory or blow·Pipe (Part I. §258)·, or
ἑο theManner prescribed with regard toTin Proc. LII.

T he Use aud Reastms of the Process.

1. The Reduffion of the Regulus out of the Calx of

Antimony is performed the most easily of all Metals.
It is enough, if you add to the Calx’s of Antimony
only Charcoal-dust‚ or any Kind of Phlogiston what-
ever: Nor need you have Recourse to a melting
fiseustruum, on Accountof its Fufibility. But there

happens
