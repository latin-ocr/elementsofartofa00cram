20 The ART of

58. Lead is of all Metals that which acquires less
Brittleness by being mix'd with Tin: Though it be-
comes somewhat more rigid.

59. Filings of Iron, or very thin Laminae of it,
being presently made red in the Crucible, if you pour
upon them the double Qantity of Tin, on a great
Fire, they will turn into a brittle white Regulus,
yielding quickly to the Attraffion of the Load-Stone.
And here you must have a very quick Fire, lest too
great a Qantity of Tin should be consumed. In or·
der to which, and for the quicker melting of the Iron,
it will be proper to add a Qantity of Argol, that
is the crude Tartar of Wine, and Glass.

60. The Vapours of ‘sin are infinitely noxious to
Silver, Gold, and Copper3 as they render thern brit-
tle : Nay, if you sprinkle ever so little Tin in the Fire
where these Metals are to be put, the most ductile
of them, being made red on such a Fire, becomes
so very untraftable, that the least Touch ofa Hammer
will make it split like Glass. frherefore, if the smallest
Qantity of Tin should happen to fall into the Fire ;
the whole must be taken out of it with great Care, and
the Fire be made once or twice stronger ·, thatwhatever
Part of Tin remains, may be entirely diffipated.

61. Copper melts together with Silver and Gold,
witness all our Coins and Utenfils, and makes them
harder3 whereas they could hardly otherwise be ap-
plied to any use in common Life, on account of their
great Softness.

62. Copper put on the Fire with Iron, promotes
the melting of the latter: However it becomes itself
more rigid and more pale by this Mixture. But it
will be proper, in order to make this melting more
successful, to throw upon it as much Tartar and com-
mon Glass, as would be neceffary to cover the Surface
of the whole Mass.
