this Manner by the Load-stone; as has been evidenced
by a Multitude of Experiments made with it. · Now,
whether any Body contains Iron in it‘or n0‚ we find «,
with the Load-stone in the following Manner. You
first reduce the Body to be tried into a fine Powder:
which must be done in a brass—Mortar, especially
if the said Body be hard, but never in an iron one z
then you put this Powder into a Crucible, having a
Cover to it, and well luted, either without any
Addition, or, for greater Security, with a stnall
Qantity os Tallow 3 and make it red hot for about
an Hour in a strongFire. When it is grown cold,
if you extend it upon a smooth Paper, bring the
Load·st0ne itself‚ or its armed iron—Poles near to it ὕ.
If there are any iron-Particles in this Powder, they
will apply themselves either to the Load-stone itself‚
or to its armed Poles, and hang on it like Beards.
When you see this, wipe off the adhering Particles,
that they may fall asunder, and then put the Load-
stone again into the Powder, and rnove it up and
down. By the same Thing often repeated, you will
at last have taken away all the Iron, leaving only the
Particles that partake not of Iron.

360. But there are very few iton-Ores attracted
by the Load-stone, before they have been made red
hot in the foregoing (ξ 359.) Manner, not excepting
even the Blood-stone (ᾗ 349), though ever so rich of
Iron. Which is the more wonderful, because Iron,
though adulterated with other Metals‚ or Semi-metals,
and even mixt with Arsenick‚ is not thereby ren-
dered altogether unapt to be attracted by the Load-
stone. Antimony is the only metallick Body, that can
hinder this Action. Sulphur can hardly hinder it,
because the Blood-stone just mentioned, red Chalk,
Oker, and the more solid ison-Ores, that are not of
the Pyrite kind, lose but very little, and some of

³* 1f you have not a Load-stone at hand, the Blade of a Knife or
ony other polished Piece of Iron which hath been touched on a Load-
stone, will have the same Effefi, but not so strongly.
