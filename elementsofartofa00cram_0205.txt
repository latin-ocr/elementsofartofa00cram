der, and lightly moistened, and then another Stratum
of the Body to be diffolved, upon the foregoing, and
then again one Stratum of the Menstruum, and so
on 3 Affayers‚ on this Account, have called this Oper-
ation Cernentation‚ from the Analogy it has with the
Works of Masons‚ when they make Walls.

460. However, there are other volatile Bodies be-
fides aeid Menstrua (§ 153.) that are joined in the
same Manner (§ 459.) to fixt Bodies. For Instance,
if such a Union cannot be made otherwise, than by
Means of a strong and long-lasting Fire, that may
diffipate the volatile Parts, then, by ufing a Cemen-
tation‚ the volatile Menstruum, to which you some-
times add some fixing Body, is rendered capable of
sustaining a more violent Fire without evaporating‚
the free Action of the Air being stopped3 and the
Body itself which is thus to be diffolved, being also
attenuatecl, and more opened by the same Action of
the Fire, is extremely well disposed to receive soon
the volatile Menstruum. Thus Arsenick and Sulphur-
are conveniently united with Iron and Copper, and
are easily corroded by a small Qantity of Acili, to
which they refist more obstinately at other Times
Pure Iron impregnated in this Manner with a great
Qiantity of Phlogiston, changes into Steel: for the
Aelion of the Air being stopped in this Operadon,
there are hardly any Bodies totally deprived of their
Phlogiston by the Violence of the F ire. Char-coals
are so least of any ·, because, though they were ever
so minutely pulverized, they sustain for whole Days
together the most violent Fire, in a Veffel which is
but negligently covered, yet without being quite burnt
to Alhes, But you will in vain expe& the Effe&
clesioed, unless you use an exaft Regimen of the Fire
in these Operations.

461. There are some Bodies fixt of themselves,
which may be rendered volatile, by adding volatile
Bodies to them ·‚ so that they are, by different De·-
grees of F ire, resolved into dry Vapours. If Vapours
thus produced colle& together, when you oppose to

them
