Lead·, for Glass- gall melts so soon as it begins to be
slightly red. But the Veffel must be closely shut,

lest the Phlogiston should be easily diffipated3 for
Experience has taught, that, in a Veffel well closed,

a Piece of Charcoal‚ such as is the black F lux can
hardly be deprived of its oily Par,t on Account of
the Action of the Air’ s being hindered· . The com-
mon Salt that swims a-top‚ serves also for the same
Purpose, as it stops every Way all immediate Corn·
munication with the external Air.

3. You are to observe as to the Regimen of'the
Fire‚ that in the Beginning it must be moderate for
a While; because the Bodies reducible out of Lead,
foam very much while they are reduced into a me
tallick Form by the Phlogiston‚ which you may per-
ceive, if you pour a small Qantity of Charcoal-
Dust, upon Litharge melting softly ln a Test under
the docimastical Furnace3 and this happens by mix-
ing a very small Quantity of Phlogiston 3 wherefore
you seldom melt Litharge, but it foams and boils
with a hiffing Noise. For this Reason, if the Fire
is encreased too much, the calcined Ore, exac‘tly
mixt with a Flux of Charcoal and Salt‚ rises into a
Foam, makes its Way through the Lute‚ and the
Lead is thus for the most Part dispersed in GrainS.
This is prevented, if you make the Fire not very
great, till the Reduffition is persormed: Of this you
have a Sign, when the noisy Ebullition‚ which hap-
pens during the Reductiom ceases3 provided it is
not occasioned by the Moistness of the Flux. But
as this Reduction is performed in a Fire much great-
er than is neceffary to melt the Flux itself, the boil-
ing Matter is mean while retained by the Body still
remaining solid, and hindei-’d from dilating itselfto

ν such a Degree. Therefore, when the Reduffion is
at last made in a great Fire, you no sooner increase
this, but the whole meles, so that the Lead adhering
in Grains in the Flux may be precipitated. Never-
theless‚ a too violent Fire is more hurtsul, than one

continued a little longeg-J than it ought to be. {9¹²
