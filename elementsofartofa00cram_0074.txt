58 The ART of

Ashes: And when this is done, the Matter must be
moistened with Water only3 because the Clay
makes the Aihes stick sufficiently together. How-
ever, take care that too much of Clay be not added ·‚
And you must always reo-ard the several Degrees of
Patness of this Earth. (5) Π tl³¹ ε Ashes of Bones
are not g: ound too coarse, their being splinkled with
puxc W <tter mal< εε them so coherent, that there is
no ΞΞεε d. of ιΞΞάΞΞΞΞὲς my Chy, or mucilaginous Fluid‚
to increase the: Colxcsxon 3 for Coppels (esf this kind,
as well as those made with Spaad (§173.) need
hardly be made hot beloto the Metal is put into
them.

Coroll. It is then plain, why the Operation done
in a Coppel made with Alhes of the Bonos of Beasts‚
of Filh Bonos, or with Parget of Spaad, lasts a lit-
tle longer, but Ξε more securle ly performed, than if
Wood ²:225* ΞΞεε ho. l been mixt to it. For as it re—
ceives more ssowly a vitrified Metal, on account of
its own compa& Substance3 so it is less to be feared,
that any thing of a perfet‘t Metal should be absorb-
ed3 thoogh the Management of the Fire be not so
i'crupuloussy minded.

183. These small vessels made of Assles (§ 168.)
serve for docimastick Operations not very exten-
five: But if a larger Qantity of Metals is to be
work’d upon, we accordingly use greater Coppels,
one Foot and a half broad, commonly called Tcst.
But these are made with Wood—ashes3 but not pre—
pared with so much Care as (ᾗ 174.) They add
to them Brick-dust beaten very fine. In this
case, they use for Moulds either the earthen Pot,
or the Iron ring rep relented (Plat. Ι, Fig. VIII.
and XI.)

184. The manner of making them is as follows:
(Ξ) In an earthen Veffel not ghzed within, and by
its Depth and Largeness proportioned to the diffe-
rent Qlantity of ΜεῑΞΙ to be put ΞΞΞ it. Let the
infide of Ξῖ be well moisteoed with V‘vatem that the

Ashes to be put into it may adhere the better. ἐξ.)
