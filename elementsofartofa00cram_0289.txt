3. You may pour it out, in the same Manner as
you have done the remaining Calx of Silver, in the
foregoing Process (Νο. 3). But the first Diffolution
being saturated‚ must either be drawn off <Part Ι.
§ 125) to separate from it the Silver, which will
then be perfeffly pure, or it must be diluted with
Water: Put it into very clean thin copper Plates‚
and immediately the Silver will first cover the Copper
all over, under the Form of very thin and small
Leaves, and then by Degrees be precipitated to the
'Bottom, and the Solution which was before destitute
of Colour, shall be tinged with agreenish azure Co-
lour: Pour this together with the Calx into an edul⁴
corating Veffel (Part Ι. Plat.11. Fig. XIII) and ex-
pose ita While to a Fire almost strong enough to
make it boil : Thus all the Silver will at last be dis-
engaged: Decant the Solution of Copper from the
lighter filver-Dust subsiding, and pour upon it at sc-
vera] times Water, which must boil till it becomes
perfeffly infipid. Finally, let the dulcified Calx of the
Silver be melted together with Borax, first by a gen-
tle Hecu, and then by a strong Fire. But this Sil-
ver will not be perfectly free from Copper.

The Use and Reasons of the Process.

See on this Point (Part I. §472. and the foregoing
Process) and observe moreover, that, unless you
pour out the Solution of Silver warm, some Crystals
of Silver will be produced, very difficule to be dis-
solved, which surround the Remainder of the Gold
in such Mamer, that the Silver remaining to be cor-
roded off from the Gold with recent Aqua Fortis, is
very difficult to bc diffolved.
