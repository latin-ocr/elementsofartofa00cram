upon them the iron·Grate (Fzg XII.) which you are
to introduce through the upper Mouth of the Fur-
nace : Then put in the Middle of this Grate a Brick
or square Tile, very smooth every where, war-med,
and perfeffly dry: Otherwise the Veffels put upon
it, especially the large oneS, are easily split by the
moist Vapours coming out of it in the Operation.
Let the Height and Depth of this stone be a small
Matter broader and higher than the Bottom of the
Crucible or Pot to be set upon it : For if it were less
high, the Bottom of the Veffel could not be suffici-
ently warmed ·, and if it were less broad, the Veffel
might easily fall from it. Then put upon this Tile
the Veffel containing the Matter to be melted, and
surround it immediately with Coals on every Side,
which must be ranged according to the Method pre-
scribed before (§ 234). Then you govern the Fire,
by opening and lhutting the Door of the Ash-hole
(Fig. IX. b'): You excite it by purting the Cover
(Fzg. VII.) upon the Body of the Furnace; and if
besides you put the Funnel (ᾗ 232. N0 8.) upon
the cylindrical Mouth (d) of this cover, the melting
Fire becomes still more violent. But if you more-
over introduce the Bellows through the Hole of the
bottom Part (Fig. IX. d), and the joint of the Fur-
nace with the bottom Part, and the Door of the Ash-
hole, unless it can be shut very close, being exaffly
stopt with thin Lute [or Windsor Loam] the Fire
thus excited by the blast of the Bellows is carried
⁵ to the highest Degree, and far surpaffes that which
may be made in a Smith's Forge, Another Advan-
tage of this Method is, that theVeffels are not so easily
broken, because the blowing of the Bellows cannot
affe& them immediately, *and because aFire perfeffly
equal is excited on every Side. One may easily ex-
amine with this Apparatus, how Stones are affe&ed by
the Violence of the Fire only. Now, if you have a
mind to perform any Operation without aVessel, and
with a naked Fire ; for Instance, to melt and reduce
the Calxs or Scorias of Copper, Tin, Lead, and Iron, -
