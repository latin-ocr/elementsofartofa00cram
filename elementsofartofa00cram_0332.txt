more Iron and unmetallick Earth it contains, the
more it proves refrastory in the F ire. Now, if such
Pyrites melt in the Roasting, as happens to some
of them, if they grow but a little red-hor, the Sul-
phur and Arsenick that lyes hidden therein‚ are so
strictly united with the fixt Part, that you would in
vain attempt to diffipate them: Nay, in this Case‚
when it is reduced again into a Powder‚ it requires a
much greater Time, and Accuracy in the Regimen of
the F ire, to perform the Operation. For this Rea-
son it is much better to repeat it with new Pyrites.
But you can roast no more than the double Qan-
tityat once of the Ore, you have a Mind to im-
ploy in the foregoing Experiment: to the End that
the Precipitation by Fufion not succeeding, there
may remain still another Portion intire 3 ¹ lest you
should be obliged to repeat a tedious Roasting: If
you see the Sigus of a ferreous refrastory Pyrites‚ the
Operation must be performed with a greater Fire,
and much more quickly. However, take Care not
to do it with too violent a Fire: For a great deal of
Copper, is consumed not only by the Arsenick, but
also by the Sulphur‚ and this happens even in Veffels
ihut very close, when the Sulphur is expelled by a
Fire not quite so strong: Which a reiterated and
milderSublimation ofthe Sulphur, in aVeffel both very
clean and well closed, will clearly ssiew.

2. When the greatest Part of the Sulphur and the
Arsenick sis diffipated‚ by such Causes as promote
Colliquation, you may make a stronger Fire: But
then it is proper to add a little of some fat Body 3
ior this diffolves mineral Sulphur‚ it changes the
Mixture of it in some Part, which for Instance con-
sists in a certain Proportion of Acid and Phlogiston‚
and at the same Time hinders the Metallick Earth to
be reduced into Copper, from being burnt to an Ex-
cesS. From these Effects the Reason is plain, why
Assayers produce less Metals in the trying of Veins
of Copper, Lead, and Tin, than lkilful Smelters do
in large Operations, F or, the former pergcirmstfhe
