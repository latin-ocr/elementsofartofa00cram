160 The ΛΚΤ of

403. Merwry, and its Ore, Cinnabar (§ 402.) is
more seldom found than any Metal ; so that accord-
ing to the Calculations of Dr. Hffnan †‚ there is
fifty Times more Gold got every Year out of the
Mines, than Mercury or its Ore. This indeed is
very true, but it seems to be no less certain, that
Mercury and its Ore offer much more frequently than
we think, but are not known to us. This will ap-
pear probable to any that will consider, that Metal-
lu1·gi.ls try the Minerals unknown to them, in a strong
open Fire only, making with them Scorifications,
Coppellations, and various meltingPrecipitations; and
neglect, or perhaps are ignorant of those Operations
that are made in close Veffels·, because they hardly
ever think of Mercury‚ except when Quickfilver it-
self, or the scarlet Colour ofits Ore (ξ 402) offers
to their EyeS. Befides, the Colour, Weight, and
Figure of Cinnabar (which is nevertheless most eafily
distinguished from other Minerals, when pure) are
altered to such a Degree by the other Minerals mixt
with them, that it can never be detected by the mere

outward View, and without making an Experi-
ment.

Coroll. You will indeed find in the VVorks of Che-
mist8‚ several Experiments mentioned, by which
they say that Mercury has been fetched out of Mi-
nerals3 but all these Experiments are here of little
Service to us, For, 1. These Minerals are not ex-
aftly described3 so that they could not be distin-
guished, if they should offer to us: And if they have
been called by a Nmne, the same is also common to
many other Things‚ or the Signification of it known
to noneshut the Author himself. 2. The Particulars

neceffary in the relating of Experiments, have been
almost ehtirely omitted. ’
