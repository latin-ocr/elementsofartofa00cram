ted a Mistake‚ and the Process must be repeated.
This done, put both Portions into one and the same
Scale‚ and weigh them ·‚ you will find by the Dif-
ference of the Weight (Νο. 1.) that the Mark of Gold
imployed has been increased one or two Grains,
which proceeds from the Refidue of Silver which
the Aqua Fortis could not extract. But if both Por-
tions are less than the Mark imployed‚ it is an infalli-
ble Sign of a Dese& to be understood frorn the
three foregoing Proceffes. The Excess of Weight
proceeding from the Refidue of Silver‚ is called in
German ἰβίηἰετῇεἰέ, and must be noted exat‘tly3 that
it may. be substraeted from the Gold in the subsequent
Qartation3 that you may not believe that there
was more Gold in the Mixture‚ than there is in

reality.

‘she Use and Reasbns of the Procest.

1. By the foregoing Process (Νο. 1.) you cannot
exaffly determine, how much Silver remains in the
Gold after the Separation by Aqua Fortis .· For while
the Gold is diffolved by Aqua Regis, it is a difficult
Matter perfectly to colle& the minute Dust of Silver‚
to free it from the Acid of the Aqua Regis, and to
weigh it, without some Part of it being diffipated.
But if Gold diffolved by Aqua Regis, is again sepa-
rated from it by Inspiffation, Roasting, and Melt—
ing‚ it always suffers a Loss such as must be here con-
fidered over and above. For this Reason the Method
already mentioned is chosen, to dete& this Increase
of Silver.

2. The melting of Gold with Silver, is made with
greater Neatness and Perfestion with a little Lead in
a Coppel, than in a Crucible ·‚ nor is it then so easy
tolose any Thing of the Gold. Of this you will be
sure, if, after the Coppelling, you weigh again the
Regulus, which mustweigh four Marks : In this Case

likewise you do not bestow afterwards your Labour
