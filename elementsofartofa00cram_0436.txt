till their outward pyritose Brightness and Hardness .

do totally disappear, and even the inward when they
are beaten afresh. Do the rest asin Proc. LXXIII.
¹2 The other Pyrites, among which some are
coppery, and impregnated with a great Qantity of
Arsenidz, and many purely ferreous and sulphureous,

require a previous Roastin'g. ’1 his is performed either ·

m close Veffels (by which Operation the Sulphur is
colleeted together (Proc. LXVII) ·‚ or ina mode-
rate open Fire. The Viti-iol is not yet generated in
some of them·‚ but they must be first exposed to
an open someWhat-moist Air, as ΝΟ. 1·, or if the
Air is too dry, you promote the Production of the
Vitriol, by now,and then sprinlczling them very

ssightly with Water. Then the Vitriol is produced .

sooner or later in the several Pyrites. But some
afrord Vitriol immediately after the Roasting‚ though
in a much smaller Qantity, than when they are af·
terwards exposed to the Air in the Manner above·
mentioned. Then‚ wall] the Vitriol clean. If you

expose again to an open moist Air what remains of ,

the Edulcoration‚ which is called the Caput Mortuum,

it is commonly still impregnated with Vitriol‚ but in
a much leffer Qantity.

There are many Stones of Calamine‚ which
yield a no inconsiderable Qantity of Vitriol‚ imme-

· diately after the Roasting: Nor is it necessary to ex-
pose them any more to the Air.

‘The Use and Reasbns (gf the Process.

1. We ought here to give the Reason, why some
Pyrites turn of themselves very easily to Vitriol‚

when only exposed to a free Air, some with greater J

Difficulty, and a great many not at all, even in the

Space of many Years tog :ther And agaim why ⁴ Α

some Pyrites presently γίεἰῑὶ as much DVitriol as ⁴

= can be got out of them, when washed in warm Wa—

ter, while some must at several Spaces of Time be

again exposed to a moist Air after the Roasting. Blpt ⁴
