“ 148 The A ΒΤ of
ScholiOn. Ι. You will always fiee this cubical Figure
(ᾗ 373.) in the lead-Ore ·‚ nor was ever any other Fi-
gure ohserved in it, except such as had been given it by
some external Power or Refistance3 for, even in this
Cast’, it has always the same Forrn within. But lead-
Ores are called hy different Names, according to the va-
rious either regular or irregular Application of the Cubes
to each other, according to their Magnitude, and their
Brightneſs thereon depending, and to their Surfaces, whe-
ther smooth or rough and granulated. There is also a
Difference olqfierved in them, as to their Colour; some
being of a lighler and inore bright Colour, and others of

a darker blackifh Dye.
Scholion. II. Lazarus E1·cke1·‚ pag. 161. mentions
a· red kind of lead-Ore, which he says is ponderous and
like red Clay. But I found that this redrMineraL
which appeared to me to he lead-Ore, and has been falsely
mislaleen for Cinnabar, was nothing inore than the lead-
Ore, having here and there larger Culus, easy to be di-
stinguished by the Eye without any Helo, and an infinite
,Numher of very minute Ones, not to be seen without a
‚lvdicroscopffi and lying hidden in a red niarly Kind of
Earth : so that it does not constitute a particular Species.
‘I'hesame Author mentions in the same Place another lead-
Ore, resembling a white fitncly Stone. There are also
sandy Rocks, ‘now ana' then very rich of Lead ·, b'ut
which being well examined, contain an Ore not in the
least different froin that described (ᾗ 374). <T he Rock
indeed, which is inost' commonly soft, and on this Account
does not desserve to be called Rock, hears a true lead-Ore
which is irregular on the Outssde, looks globular, and is
filled throughout the Substance of the Rock, with small
J'A'affis of'very various Sizes, and not very bright .· so
that, when the Rock is broken, there appears thepeifebt'
Species (ξ 373) of lead-Ore. Abundance of thesse are
digged out of the sudines at Breybach. . >· ἢ
