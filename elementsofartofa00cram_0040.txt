Ἰ24. The ΑΜ· of

79. When pulverized not very'fine‚ itturns into-'2
Calx in a moderate melting Fire, which Calx being
melted by a great Fire, turns entirely into a kind of
GlasS‚ which is of a dark red Co'lour‚ half transpa-
rent, and sufficiently hard. This Gla‘ss has a greater
'Efficacy upon Bodies, than Litharge icself (ᾖ 46.—-52.)
for 11 attenuates Stones of all kinds, dissolves them,
and with a very strong open Fire carries thern away
with it in the Air.

80. Ifthis Glass does not equally change all Me-
tals‚ it turns them into Scorz'cz, and makes them vo·
latile, Gold alone excepted: Because it is thereby
'freed of all heterogeneous Matters, except of 'Silvelr
and erin, whose Separation is more difficult to be ob-
taine'd that way f, you may therefore with Reason
call it the Wolfand Devourer not Only of Metals‚
but of almost all BodieS.

81. However‚ this Affion (§8o.) of the reguline

Part of Antimony is greatly augmented.⁹ if you nse at
first a strong Fire with Veffels well closed, or throw
upon it any kind of Fat whatever: For by these
means you hinder the Regulus of Antimony from evapo-
rating immediately, and its Virtue to destroy Bodies
is oflonger Duration3 so that at last every thing va-
hishes, and is consumed by a strong and open Fire.
· However, the Regulus cf Antimony unites as vari-
oussy with different Metals, as was said (ᾗ 76.) Arse-
nick did ; for it greedily incorporates with Iron, and
next with Copper‚ &a ’

Coroll. Hence appears how near of kind Regulus of
Antimony is to Arsem'ck .· For the whole Difference seems
to be, that Arſsnick is fix’d in Antimony by a vitrifying
Earth. Whence it happens that when Antimony is
mix'd with Metals, it can hardly be consumed from
thence by Ustulation only : Nay, when being exposed
with them to the open Fire, it evaporates·‚ it in the
mean while destroys the metallick P.1rticleS‚ as soon
as 11 renders them volatile.
