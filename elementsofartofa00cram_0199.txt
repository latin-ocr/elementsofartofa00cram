with Benefit ε and when the Negative is the Case, they

most commonly forbear from any further Inquiry. For ,
this Reason, there has been hardly any Mineral hither- ,

to found, that went not through a stri& Trial in the
same View. There are even a great many compound
Minerals, among such as have been ascribed to certain
Claffes, whiefh are known only in part, and not at all
thoroughly. Of this Kind are, for Instance, the
Haemitites or Blood-stone (ᾗ 349). The filamentous
striated iron-Ore (ξ 353). The shining‚ scaly,
striated iron-Ore (ξ 352). The native Manganese
(§ 351) &a the Principles of which are not known,
except that Part of them only, thar turns into Iron.
For this Reason‚ the Iron which most commonly con«
stitutes the major Part of the Pyrioes, has long been
a Secret to the AncientS, who only regarded the Cop-
per envelopped in itr whence, the many Names gi—
ven to many Pyrites are almost all derived from
Copper ; till at last some of the Moderns, especially
the ingenious Mr. Henckel‚ gave us a compleat Analyfis
of thern in his Book cited (ᾗ 399) above.

(ᾗ 441), that which chiefly deserves our Considerati--
on is, the Molyhdoena, or otherwise called Ceraffz ni-
gra, Plumbum marinum, in English Wad or black-
Leczd‚ in German waffetssllsslep: it must not be con-
founded with the Galaena, or Steel-grained lead-Ore
(§ 373), which though commonly called by the same
Name, yet is altogether different srom it ἦ. The
black-Lead is a Mineral ofa lead Colour‚ consisting
of small shining Scales, sofr, so as to be easily scraped
with a Knife. It is much heavier than the glimmer-
Stones (ᾗ 31. Ν0 7), ofwhich it has almost the whole
Texture-: it feels much like Scap, and its rubbing

³⁸* Formerly‚ the almost only Mine for black-Lead was in Bar-
rowdale, near Keswick in Cumberland ; but a very large rich Mine
of it was fince found out at ‘Tantiusquis in New-Ez-glannd by the
famous Governor Wntrhop, at his first settling that Country. 'she
aforesaid Mine is at this Day part of the Estote oshis Grandson and
Heir John Wntlarop‚ Esq; it is found by the Curious to comam a.
great Deal of Silver,
