ASSAYING METALS. 83

as ti e Thickness of the Lute to be applied to it re-

quires· (see Fzg VIII). For the same P uxpose, let
ᾗῃὶῙΙ iron- -Hooks be fastened to the Infide of this
Door, which is intercepted by the s1id Border. And
lest this Cover should be burnt within, by the force of
Fire 3 you must cover the Infide of it over with the
same Lute mentioned before (§ 233.) for the Affay-
oven ; Therefore it must likewise be furnished with
a Ring and iron·Hooks to fasten the Lute·‚ as was
said before (N0 3.) when we spoke of the Body of
this Furnace. Belides this, you must fasten two iron-
Handles (Plat. III. stig. VII. cc) on the outfide
of this Cover. Then a round Hole must be made in
the Top of it, being three Inches in Diameter, pro-
longued into a hollow Tube (d) almost cylindricai,
and a few Inches high, upon which the ii‘on-Funnel
described (§ 232. N⁰ 8.) may, in C·1se of Neceffity,

be put after the Μῑηηεῑ mentioned m the same Place
when we spol< e of the A³ifi“·‹1y-oven.5tlyh After this,

the Lining of both the Body and Cover of the Fornace
within, is made ‘m the same Manner above deici ibed
(ξ 233). Moreover, you must make for this Fur-
nace two moveable Bottoms‚ viz. One to receive the
Affics, and admit the Air 3 the other to serve for
Reduffions. The ,first is made with an Iron Plate,
formed into a hollow Cylinder‚ open at Top‚ and
to be shut at Bottom with an orbiculat ison-Fiam, as
with a Bafis, five Inches high, and of such a Diameter‚
as that it may receive the inferior Osifice of the Body
of the Furnace (N0 2.) the Depth of half an Inch
(See Plat. 111. Fzg. IX.) Therefore, let an ἰωῇ-Βίης
(c) half an inch broad, be fastened on the infide of
the said Bottom, and at the Distance of halfan Inch
from its upper Border, to support the Body of the
Fornace put into it. Again, let this Bottom have a
square Door‚ four Inches high, apd as many Inches
broad, · tl at may be ssiut closely with a Door hung
on Hinges, that you m ly ky means of it increase or
diminish the Draught oi {the Air, an d thus govern
