AssAYING METALS. 137

leur, sometimes deep, sometimes light, fliews how
much Iron it contains in it.

345. There is also an Ore, which is very ponde-
rous, and of a red bluish Colour, when broken, and
which refists the Hammer by its HardnesS. lt is very
rich in the best kind ofIJon‚ and commonly yields in
the first Fusion, from fixty to eighty Pounds weight of
Iron, in the Center or an hundred Weight.

346. There is a fingular Species os Iron-Ore, which
has the Figure of Spaad (ξ 30, 1) : it is of a pale yel-
, lowilh Colour, though not uncommonly grey, and
even sometimes ofa half transnatent White3 it yields
in the Fusion about thirty hundredth Parts of the best
Iron, though the outward Sight of it affords no pro-
bable Sign of it whatever.

347. The yellow Pyrites (§ 316.) has indeed been
referred to the sulphureous Minerals 3 but the Propor-
tions os Iron and Sulphur being so inconstant in it,
that it is sometimes the latter, sometimes the former
which predominates in it, it may also be properly
numbered among Ores: though, it is hardly ever
exposed to the Fire, to have Iron fetched out of it, be-
cause there are Ores more abundant in this kind of
Metal.

348. If you compare the Iron-Ores hitherto
(§ 342—347.) described, with the Ores of other Me-
tals‚ they are indeed refraffitory : but those which are
to be called the most fufible (ᾗ 334.) among Iron-Ores,
are those that contain butlittle Sulphur, or sulphure-
ous Acid in them3 which is betrayed by the Smell
that strikes the Nostrils‚ while these Ores are made
red hot.

349. The Haematites (called in German ffilutffeim
Qsslwkopss and in English Blood-stone), is of a more
rer⁴ra6tory Nature in the Fire. As it is gibbose and
arched in Part, and partly angular and reffilineal,
consisting of Planes direeted towards one Point‚ on
this 'Account it looks like an irregular Pyramid:
which will appear much more s0, if you bre-ak it.

The Outfide of it is pretty well polished, wlienRthet
