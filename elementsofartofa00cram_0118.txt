it is an Instrument of the utmoff Importance in

263. Let this Balance be made of the best Steel z
For it may be constrnffited much better of this Metal,
which must be of the hardest Kind‚ though suffici-
ently traetable, than of any other Matter. Belides,
Steel i's not so easily spoiled with Rust, as Iron ; and it
is more apt thanother Metals‘ totake a perse& polim,
which at the same Time prevents the R-ust. Mean
while, let the Steel to be employed for this, be temk
pered a little sotter than a perfeet Spring ; that it may
return to its State, when ssightly bent ·, for it cannot

be eafily mended.

hardly different from that of common Scales‚ other‘·
wise than by its Nicety and Smallness. The longer
the Bcam of it (Plat. V. Fzg. ΙΙ.) is, the more small
Faults will be senfible in it: Therefore‚ the longer
must be prefered to the ffiorter. However, ten or
twel've Inches are a sufficient length. Let the Thick-
