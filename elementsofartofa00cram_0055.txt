led Aqua Regis. To have it excellent, put in a Glass=
Retort Aqua Fortis of the best kind, well proved, arrd
of the requifite Strength (§ 122, 124.) add to it half
the Qantity of common Salt‚ perfeffly dry, and pul-
verized; and in a Sand-Bath force up the Spirits‚ first
by a ssow, and finally by a strong Distillation. Ox·
if you put into Aqua Fortis one quarter Part of Sala
Ammonias, or of Spirit ofSalt (ξ 126)·, it immediate-
ly affumes 'a yellow Colour, and emits abundantly the
white Vapours of the S pirits of Sale, which soon pro-
duces true Aqua Regis. However, you are to take
Care, in this second Meth0d‚ that the Veffel contain-
ing the Mixture be not presently shut up close: For
in that case it would burst. Resides, this Mixtme
must be made under the Chimney, lest the suffocating
Spirits should spread all over, and fill the Labora-
tor .

1y 29. Aqua Regis, diffolves perfeffly Iron, Copper‚
Tin, Gela, Mercury, Regulus of Antimony‚ Bzfhzuth,
and Zink. It even dissolves Leacl more than S piriz: of
Salt does; however, it becomes somewhat troubled in
the Operation. If it has its requifite Degree of
Strength, it does not diffolve Silvcr : But if you have
put in the Mixture a Qlantity of Salt Ammoniac,
or of Mariae Sall, or of Spirit of common Salt, not
sufficient, it then corrodes deer, may, iteven dissolves
it in part, this Aqua Regis being imperfest.

Coroll. The Reason is then {blf-evident, why in the
Separation of Sil-ver and Gold by Aqua Regis, it is bet-
ter to use a antity of spirit of Sall, οι· of fisarine
Sall, or of Sall Awwoniac, exceeding, tham one short
of the right Measure. Nor is it less evident thence,
why an exa& Separation of Silver and Gaeld is better
effeffed with Aqua Fortis than with A'qaa Regin :113
the formet· never corrodes Gela, whereas the latter
corrodes Silver frequently.
