be observed in any Iron-ore, though it be ever so fu».
fible in its kind·, because it wants a far more violent
Fire to be melted‚ than any other Ore whatever.

Nay, it is proper also here to use an unmetallick Barth,
altogether unfufible by itself‚ which enters in greater
Quantity into the Compofition of the Pyrites‚ as it
contains a leffer Qantity ofCopper. But both these
are freed, bya violent Fire suddenly applied to them,

from the Sulphtir which is in some Measure fixed ιιι
the Pyrites, and cannot evaporare very quickly·, and
the Iron is at the sarne Time leparated from the Cop-

per, and thus the Copper is freed frorn Sulphur‚ by
MeSans of Iron, and reciprocally from Iron, by Means
of ul hur.

3. gy the sime Method‚ you will obtain Silver,
Gold‚ and Copper, if the Ores in which they lie
hidden‚ aie dispersed among ι re ttthity ofStones
and Pviites‚ which admit os>D no VN albing3 nor can
the Metal be separated thercfrom with Benefit‚ by
any other Nlethod hitherto known: for Instance,
astet such an Ore has been beiten to a coarle Pow
der, if there is not already a sufficient Qantity
of yelloxv sulphureous Pyrites ιιι it3 you must chufe
sulphuieous Ir-on pyrite& and even among those you
have at hand, thole that contain the greatest Qan-
tity of Silver, Gold‚ and Copper3 for by this Means
you obtain ιιι one fingle Oper iation, and at the· same
Expeuoe, the abov esaid Mettis which sometimes
ςιιιιιοῑ be fetched with Benefit out of the Pyrites,
by a particular ProcesS. Yon must add fusible Scoria³s
to these Ores and Pyrites, especially those that re-
nmin of the Melting os lead-Ore, and those chiefly
outof which a little Lead may still be secched‚ · or even
the very Ore of· L ead itself: Nay, some other addi-
ti onal Inoredients too, thit are easy to be rnelted ei-
ther of their own Nature, οι· at least by the Me-
thods here presciibeth and the Qantity and Choice
ol which cm hardly be determinet! with Certainty,
otherwise than from a long Experience m these Mat-

ter s, by Experiments, and a great Attention to every
Circumstance.
