. whether simple or mixt in any Proportion and Man·-

ner whatsoever, whether calcined orjoined to Glaffes, ’

differ very much according to the Degree and Dura-
tion of the Fire, which you have employed during
the Calcination of the Metals, and the fusion of them
with Glass when they are melted3 so, that it is hardly
credible, that the same Glass, taken out of the Fire
at different Times, should appear under such a Va-
riety of Forms·, nay, that the Colours of it should
vaniss] entirely. Secondly, there are Metals the Calx's
of which give Glaffes a light colom, and others which
being calcinetl make them os the cleepest Dye :
Whence it happens, that when such Bodies are mixt
together, the Colour os the one or the other grows
quite obscure, and vanishes entirely. But, there are
seldom Ores, in which one single Metal lies hid alone:
And there are almost always two or more of them
joined in the same Matrix, and in a Multitude of
Ways, Proportions, and Qualities. But then the
Colours resulting theresrom, are os the greatest Va-
riety‚ distinguishable again by the Eye‚ but impoffi-
ble to be described, and so infinitely multiplied, that
the most experienced Artifices could hardly indicate
the least Partof their Causes. Other MetaIS, on the
contrary, will not manifest themselves at all by any
Colour, in such a Mixture. Let there be, for Instance,
Ores, in which Lead and Copper lie hid in many
Proportions‚ the Copper, however, not being in too
small a Qantity therein. Melt one Ounce os crystal-
line Glass with a few Grains of this Ore: The Co-
lour will prove of a bluilh green Dye, and the Lead
that was hidden in that small Qantity of Ore,
though it were ten Times more than the Copper,
will not in the least betray its Presence by the Co-
lour, nor will the specifick Hardness and Weight of
the Glass be senfibly increased by so minute a Qan-
tity : If you add a great Deal of the Ore, the Colour
' will be totally obscured'by the Copper. The same
will, in this Case, take Place in Tin, Silver, Gold,

and Antimony. T hirdly, there are other Bodies:
