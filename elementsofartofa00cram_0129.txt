ἕο its Parts ; that for Instance it should be exa-&ly
the Double or Qadruple : By which Means the les-
fer Centner‚ together with its Parts, serve to deter.
mine also the Parte of the larger.

279. You will find out, whether the Weights are
made exest, or have contrafoed Faults in the usmg,
by comparing¹ the Centner, or its larger parts, with
the leffer ones: For Instance, the whole Centner,
with 64, 32, and 4 lib. the 64 lib. with 32 lib. and
with two 16 lib. and so on. It is then proper to have
two Weights of each peculiar Part of the hundred lb.
Which is the more easily done, because in the making
of the Weights, it is a most tedious Work to deter-
mine the right Qantity of the granulated Lead z·
Which being once done, it is an easy Matter to pre-
pare two fivlver-Plates equipoifing the same Qantity
ef granulated Lead.

28'0. Put these Weights (§1277‚ 278.) into a small
Case or Box‘, that may be shut, and in which there
are for each of them proper and neat small Partitions
contrived, and lined with Leather or Cloth: Thai:
every one may immediately be found, and that many·
of them being put together in one and the same Par-
tition‚ may not rub against and wear out each other„
whereby they are very eafily spoiled.‚

Scholion. In the making of the Wezghts (§ 277.) some
‘nse to determine thesmallaest of thern first, and then to aro
rive at the hundred lb. by multiplying ·‚ bnt then an in-
sensshle Error committed in the smallelt Weight, becomes-
very confiderable, as it is ntullz'plied over and over, and'
you lost’ all your Labour. On the contrary, tfyou first
determine the largest Weight, as someztse to do ·‚ you have
much ado afterwards to find out the finallest .· For it is
hardly poffibte to proceed with dividing into two, from
100 to 2 5, and more. This is the Reason why I begin ι
from 64 lb. not‘making any Wezghts of 50, or 25 lb 3
because they may eastly be obtained by the Comoinotz'on of'
the others.

ing to the different Places : For it often contains [ιέζὲ
