AssAYING METALS, 143

any Addition‚- are not attracted by the Load—stone,
if you melt them either alone without adding any
Phlogiston‚ or only byMea'ns ofan unphlogisticalFlux‚
in the strongest Fire‚ will turn into a metallick Glass‘‚
not into a Regulus. 2. With this mass, and by
Means ofa due Addition of PMogiston, you will pro-
duce the most perfect Iron in the Fire. 3. Iron de-
stroyed by Acids, Fire‚ or any other Metuis, or only
turned into Rust, is not a “rafted by the Load-stone:
and then when it is melted by a strong Fire, Without
adding Phlogiston to it, the same Thing happens,
that was mentioned (N0 1). Whence it is plain, that
by an inflammable Oil, Iron is produced from what
was no Iron. See (ᾗ 90-95). Nor is it a Contra-
diction to this Opinion‚ that some Ores receive a
magnetick virtue, though made red hot withoutany
thing added to them. For nothing hinders the Phlo-
giston, which is neceffary to constitute the metallick
Nature, from being already present in the Ore,
though it be not as much united with the fine Part
that constitutes the Iron, as is required to give it its
metallick Form: so that it is necessary previoussy
to unite it thereto by the Aetion of a strong Fire 3

· which is always requifite in all Redustions.

361. Native Copper, that is Copper in its metal-
lick Form‚ is found much more frequently and more
perfect than Iron. However‚ it is yet somewhat
less malleable than Copper well forged.

362. It must be observed of copper—Ores in gene-
ral, that none ofthem distinguilhes itself by any cer-
tain Figure ‚ but that they are almost all of them
irregular. But the finest Colours of any Kind‚ red
and the diaphanous Colours excepted‚ most commonly

⁴betray the Presence of Copper, when they are to be

seen in any Ore. For this Reason‚ there is hardly
any copper-Ore, that is not mixt with Iron in greater
Qantity, than the Ores of other Metals commonly

are. NeverthelesS, there is a much less Qantity of
it
