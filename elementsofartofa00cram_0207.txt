tion anot-her of the same Kind, somewhat‘smaller,
boi-ed at Bottom in the same Manner as the first Pot
which was set on the Cover: You may, if there is
any Neceffity, put upon this second Pot a third
of the same Kind, and in the same Manner: Secure
the Joints of the Cover and Pots on the outfide, with
Lute not very tenaciOUS, that the Pots may be easily
taken away and separated. The Pots, or other Ves-
sels adapted to this Use, are commonly called Aludu-
lior Aludels.

463. Roasting, called in German issustm, is when

volatile Bodies are separated from fixt ones by the
combined Action of Fire and Air.
· Coroll. Therefore this Operation agrees with the
Sublimation (§ 461, 462), when a volatile Body re-
solved in Vapours, is collet‘ted: because, after this
Manner, Sulphur and Arsenick are extraded out of
a great many OreS‚ and are refined.

464. But this Separation (ᾗ 463.) is sometimes dif-
ficult enough, when, for Instance, the whole com-
pound Body melts in almost the same Degree of
Fire, that is neceffary to cause a volatile Body to be
diffipated in the Air. Therefore, it is chiefly neces·
sary at that Time, 1. Previoussy to pound a little ¹the
Body to be roasted, that its Surface contiguous to the
Air may be increased: (2.) A gentle Fire is required:
(3.) A freer Access of the Air, which is the Vehicle
of Vapours. (4.) When the Body roasting grows
into large Clots, the Surface of it must be restored to
its former Extent‚ by repeating the pounding.
(5) It is necessary that the Matter be spread wide,
and never collected in a Heap. Bodies refractory in
the Fire, are more easily roasted: for you may con-
stantly use a great Fire to them, nor need you repeat
the Operation so often. However, you must always
take Care, that, while the volatile Bodies are diffi-
pating, they, at the same Time, do not take some-
thing from the fixt ones (ξ 461). For this happens
in a great many Cases, when you use too impetuous
