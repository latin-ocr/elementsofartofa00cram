'¹294 The ART os

Arsenick is much more sixt, and more strongly ad;
herent to the Ores, than Sulphur; nay, when with
a black Flux, it turns into a semimetallick Regulus,
which being joined with Lead, a great Part of it
most suddenly turns into (Part I. ᾗ 73.) Glass. And
as there is but very little Iron in such a Pyrites 3 xthat
Iron has not the Virtue of hindering this Effe& of
the Arsenick.

4. The Lead which is got out of such a pyritose
Ore, is not commonly so pure as that which proceeds
from a purer Ore 3 but it is found blackilh and less
ductile. The Cause of this Difference is Copper,
which lies hidden in leffer or greater Qantity in e-
very PyriteS‚ and which is reduced at the same Time,
and melts with the Lead into one Regulu53 where-
fore it must be separated by a particular Eliquation.

⁴1. T H E washing of the Lead-ore is performed in

the same Mamer, as that of the suver-ore.
(Proc. XIII.) But take Care not to be deceived by
the great Weight of the Ore·, for when it is inclo-
sed in a Matrix that is a little hard, the very brittle
Lead-ore, on Account of its foliaceous Texture, is,
by the frequent Beating of the Pestle‚ broken into a
very thin‚ scaly Powder, which swims in Water, in
form of a blew Powder,

2. lf the remaining Ore is rendered pure by the
Washing, let it be melred, as in Proc. XXX. If
you find it pyritose and full of Iron, do what has
been prescribed, Proc. XXXI.
