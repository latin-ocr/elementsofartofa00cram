‘247 The th1rdl ind ofTonos (Plat. IV Fig IV. )are ,
adapted to melting Crucibles ol a middle Size, three
Foot long, having very strong Legs, and as to the
rest madeo lik e the first (ξ 245), except that each of
the Ι egs must be bent downwards at their Extremi-
ties‚ into a sort of Beak‚ some Inches long, and one
Inch and a half broad3 that the Sides ol the Cruci-
ble being sqneezed fast between these, it may be hel-d
steddily. shese Fongs are chiefly used, when Me-
tals melted in Veffels of a middle Size‚ are to be
pour-ed out into Moulds or Ingote.

248. The largest Veffels, containing a great Quan-
tity of Metal, are more easily cracked in the Fire
than the small ones·‚ and their Cracks, if they do
not proceed from the Moistness of the file set under
them, are always found in the highcr and larger Part
of the Vess'el, and most commonly run from the Top
towards the Bottom‚ seldom transversely. To be
able to take such Vessels safely out of the Fire ; you
must have Tongs stronger and longer (th. V.) than
the foregoing (ᾗ 247). Let one of their Legs be-
curved a small Matter at the End, and end in a strong
Semi-circle eight Inchcs in Diameter, and so fixed, as
that it may make halfright Angles with the Leg of
the Tongs (ωε Let the other Leg be curved in the
same Manner at the End, and have at its Extremity
two Semi-circles like the fomgoing, but so fituated
among themselves, and with regard to the foregoing‚
that they may be distant from each other about one
Inch, so that there may be a Space in which the Semi-z
circle of the other Leg may be received (b): The Effe&
of this Struecure is, that small and large Veffels may
be managed with them. The Vefl'el to be taken our,
is laid hold of a little below its upper Border, with2
the curved Extremity of these TongS, which must
be first heated just red hot in the Fire; and being
'thus surrounded with a whole Circle, is safely‚taken
out of the Fire.

249. When the Matter put into small Veffels is to

be stirred 3 you must make use of an iron—Hook,
