ASSAYING METALS. 293·

<she ιφ, and Reasom osane Process-

1. If the Ores of Lead are charged with Pyrites,
a greater Qantity of the saline Flux, which dis-
poses these Earths to a Vitrification‚ is required, on
·Account of this refractory Qality, proceeding part-
ly from the martial, and partly from the unmetal-
lick Earth, and for the same Reason the F ire must
be made a little stronger·‚ that a sufficient Precipi-
tation of the Lead out oof them may be made.

As every Ργῑίῑετε already contains a martial Earth
in it, which is reduced to a metallick Form, when
it is melted together with an oily reducing Flux, for
this Reason‚ this Earth produces here the same Ef-
fest, that was produced by the Use of the Iron—fi·
lings in the foregoing Process; that is, it becomes
capable of purifying Lead from the heterogeneous
Bodies mentioned in the same Place. Nor does it
hinder the Degree of the Fire which is used for
melting the Lead ore, from being fit to precipitate
Iron out of its Ore into a Regulus: Ior it is enough,
provided it returns to its metallick State·, which a
middling 1⁴1re with some Phlogiston will effeet3 for
then I1on is already fit for the above· mentioned Pur-
pose. But you are to observe, that the martial
Earth destitute of Phlogiston, and any produ& of
Iron whatever, deprived of Phlogiston, by the vio-
lence of the Fire, is not fit to absorb Sulphur,
Arsenick, Andmony, and thelik e·‚ nevertheless by
joining the Phlogiston to it again, it recovers its
tormer Virtue. You must lik ewise examine, whe-
ther the Pyrite31s in a sufficient Qiantity in the Lead
ore· ‚ if not, its Dese& must be supplied with a lit·
tle Filings of Iron.

3. Itis neceffary to let a sufficient Roasting pre-
ceed; for Iron, already saturated with Sulphur in a
Pyrites, has not the same Effe& as pure (See Pam„
XXX. Ufi’ No. 1.) Iron. A strong Roasting is
chiefly required, when the Pyrites arc arsenical·, for
