ASSAYING METALS. 273

the rest (See Part I. § 152, ξῡῗς.) However‚ Fire
cannot dissipate any Thing of Silver diffolved in this
Manna-1· -, though it acquires such a Degree of Vola-
tiiity, especially through the Spirit of Salt: This
seems. to proceed from the Aetion of the Air's being
prevented.

2. Salt Ammoniac may also be imployed in the
second Cernent3 though the Spirit of Salt is more
eafily expelled out of it, even without any Addition :
which is sswwd by the Liquid that precedes its Subli-
mation. Resides, Salt Ammoniac itself has a very
strong Power over the other Metals. But as it is so
very deur, and the whole Bufiness may be performed
at last with common salt, Cements for this Reason
may be done without it. The same Thing must be
observed of all the other Ingredients‚ which enter
int-⁴) Cernentationffi besides those already mentioned.
Observe moreover, that, by a Variety of Additions‚
you sometimes communicate to Cements a stony Con-
fistence„ which cannot be conquered, and lose pretty
often Part of your Gold, or even change the aeid
Vapours to such a Degree, that they cannot exert
their Aetion, or at least are of no Service at alh, so
that you increase your Charges much more thanis
¹neceffiry. Thus, sometimes they prescribe several
Proportions of Gem, Fountain, or Marine Salt, of
which the different Effects are a perfect Secret to me.
The same is true of the BIoodstme, the Crocus ,Mar-
tis‚ the white Vitriol, the costly Verdigrease‚ the
blew-Vitriol‚ the plumose Allum, and the like·, of ,
which Kinds of odd Mixtures we have a Multitude
prescribed by several Authors„ who have written of
metallick MatterS.

3. If you have a Mind to purify brittle Gold by
Cementation‚ it must be granulated‚ before you
mix it with the Cement. But as these Grains are not
all made so fine, as that the Vapours may penetrate
them thoroughly3 the Granulation must'sse repeated
as many T irneS, as they are to go through a new
