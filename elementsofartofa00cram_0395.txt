AssAYING METALS. 369

small Qantity of Arsenick in it, the free Air and
F ire diffipate it. But you can use this F usion, only
with rich and very fufible Ores.

2. If the Ore is very refractory‚ and the defired
semi-Metal lies hidden in a small Qiantity, within
very narrow Interstices, then a F ire somewhat
stronger is required, that, being more attenuated, it
'may extricate itself: But, in this Case, it will be en-
tirely diffipated‚ unless you apply to it a smoaking,
reducing Fire, which must be at the same Time mo-
derate, and in some Measure confined from it. For as
Bismuth is eafily reduced by the Phlogiston of the
F uel of the F ire, it is also soon diffolvcd into Fumes
and sublimed. Α

3. You will ⁷obtain a much greater Quantity of
Bismuth, if you melt your Ore with the black Flux‚
glast-Gall, and common Salt, in close Veffels : The
Reason of this is, that the Matrix of Bismuth, or of its
Ore, is sooner diffolved than vitrified by the F orce of
the Salts: Wherefore, the Particles of Bismuth being
then confined‚ may be more perfeffly precipitated ;
whereas, on the contrary, a great Deal of it remains
in the Chinks of the Matrix, in the foregoing Eliqua-
tions; because a Matrix of itself very refractory, is,
by the Volatility of Bismuth, hindered from turning
to Glass with Fire alone. Belides, the free Ac‘tion of
the Air, being excluded, and a reducing Body added,
the same Qantity can never be diffipated, as when
the Air and Fire act freely upon it, and a little of a
reducing Body comes to your Affistance. Mmeover,
Arsenick is most commonly joined in no small Qan-
tity with Bismuth: But this (as will afterwards ap-
pear in the Proceffes to be made with it) is reduced
*and precipitated, with saline reducing FluxeS, into
a semi-metallick Regulus, not unlike Bismuth, more
fixt than Arsenick itself, sometimes volatile enough,
which, nevertheless, meeting another Metal or semi-
Metal, mixes with it, and is fixt.

most every Kind, has something of Bismuth in it :
