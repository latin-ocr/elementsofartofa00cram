theless‚ this Sublimate does neither run out, nor get
to the Bottom of the Veffel‚ when the Fire is in-
creased : For a tenacious doughy Clamminess is in-
deed communicated -to Arsenick by too violent a
Fire ·‚ but F ire alone cannot make it mest, fince it,
on the contrary, resolves it. most quickly into a
Smoak, which finding no Way to, escape, breaks
asunder the Veffels that keep it confined. The yel-
low Arsenick assumes more eafily the solid Form of
Sublimate‚ on Account of the tenth or twentieth
Part of Sulphur mixt to it, by which Arsenick is
brought to a State of Fufion. But the red Arse·
nick, which is mixt with a still greater Qantity of
Sulphur‚ cannot even be conveniently prepared ina
Sublimation by Ascent‚ on Account of its too great
Fufibility‚ which is communicated to it by an Abun-
dance of Sulphur': But it adheres either above in
F orm of F lowers 3 or runs quite melted to the Bot-
tom of the Veffel, leaving only a thin Crust of red
transparent Sublimate, and some small DropS. There-
forc, in order to be able to prepare it quickcr‚ and
in larger Bits, it must be forced out of a Retort 3 in,
the warm, large, though not too long Neck of which
it must be condensed‚ and thence fall as yet fluid
into the Recipient applied to the Retort‚ and grow
cold. Arsenick of this Kind may be produced irn-
mediately out of Pyrites, without any, Addition, if a
sulphureous Pyrite is intermiXed with a white Arse-
nick one, or with some other Arsenick—ore, or added
to it for that Purpose. And thus you will have
yellow or red Arsenick, according to the (Qantityn
of the sulphureous Pyrites. -
