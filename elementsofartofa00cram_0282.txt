1. ’ HEN Silver has been coppelled, diffolve
· ok) it with Aqua Fortis, in a very clean glass·
Cucurbite: And if the Solution is t'h'e least in the
World turbid‚ strain it through a double filtring
Paper, into another clean glass-Veffel. Pour into
this Solution‚ by little and little, Spirit of Salt, or
Solution of common Salt‚ or Salt Ammoniack,
enough to produce a perfect Aqua Regis (Part Ι.
§ 128. Effe.) .- The limpid Diffolution will irn-
mediately become milky ε Let it rest for some Hours,
that the Silver extrac‘ted in F orm of a white Powder,
may all smk to the Bottom: Which is sooner effested,
‘by pouring a great Qantity of pure W ater upon the
Solution,·if it be highly charged. This done, de·
cant gently the Liquor at Top. But, you must pour
upon the Calx adherent to the Bottorn‚ fresh Water,
or, what is still better, Phlegm of SpiritofSalt, or
of Aqua Forti53 that all the Metal may be extracted
out ofit ι For the Calx is no longer diffolved in Aqua
Fortis, nor in Spirit of Salt. Finally, let it boi} at
several Times in fresh VVater‚ till the Calx and Wa-
ter are at last perfec‘tly infipid. Shake them toge-
ther, and pour them intoa filtring Paper, that the
Water may go through it 3 and then dry the
Calx.

2. Put it into a Crucible, well rubbed on the In-
fide with Soap, and cover it with about one Half of
any fixt alkaline Salt, very dry, and beaten to a very
fine Dust ; Squeeze the Whole well With your Finges:
Cover the Crucible with a Tile, and put it in a wind-
Furnace, and snake at first a middling Fire forr a

Qarter of an Hour, only to make the Veffels groyy
