seen very seldom. ’ Nevertheless‚ Matthafius sayS,
,that the Thing has happened sometimes,

379. The most rich tin-Ore is of a black or dark
Colour‚ ofa polyhedral, but altogether irregular
Figure3 having its Surface very gloffy. This sur-
paffes almost all the Ores of the other Metals, in its
specifick Gravity Τ : which seems to be the more won-
derful, because Tin is the lightest of all Metals. But
as Arsenick is exhaled almost pure out of this tin-Ore
in the roasting, and as the Part of it that remains af-
ter the roasting (ifyou consider how much of the Tin
is destroyed during the whole Time of the Reduftion)
is to be reckoned purely metallici< 3 it is easy enough
to guess at the Cause of this Gravity. As for the rest,
it is of a middle fflrdness, and, with regard to the
Tin itself‚ is very refractory ; for it sustains a quick
Fire‚ without either melting or growing clammy ;
and is you expose it to a sudden Heat, it neither
bursts violenssy, nor crackles‚ except when an Ex-
perimentis made upon large Lumps, among which
other Ores, or some Stones, especially of the Qartz-
Kind are intermixerl. 'I'his Ore is called in German
Zimvffitaupen, in English tin-Graiam.

350. The most common tin-Oie, called in German
‚Ztm'ttmg is of a darl< yellowilh rusty Colour: so
that on this Account it cannot, by the bare Sight,
be eafily distinguished from the iron-Ore3 especially
as it contains itself Iron. The Figure of it is irregu-
lar, and agrees in every Respect with that of the
foregoing (ᾗ 379) 3 for which Reason it seems to be
another of the same Vinci, and to differ from it only
by its Degree of Purity.

381.We may, after having explained (ᾧ 379.) what
happens to the tin-Ore in the Fire‚ find out by an
Experiment made ex tempore in the following Man-
ner, whether there is any Qantity of this Ore con-
tained in any Lump offered for Trial, and about

† Insomuch as sometimes to have a greater specifick Gravity
than a Piece of Tin of the same Size melted from it.
