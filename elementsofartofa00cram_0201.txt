446. As therefore Conjunctions are to be considered
(§ 445.) here as only secondary3 one may easilyjap-
prehend, that the docimastical Operations cannot be
divided in general into Solutions and Conjtrnffions',
as chemical Operations are. Nay‚ any Opera'tion
performed by a Chemist or an Affiyer, commonly
has the Effe& of both the Solution and the Conjun-
&ion ς so that no Solution-ean ever be performed with-
out a new Conjunction, nor any Conjunction without
a Solution. For Instance‚ while heterogeneous¹ Eo-
dies are separated from Gold and Silver by Scorifica-
tion, do nott the Particles of Gold and Silver melt
together into a greater Bulk? Likewise, do not the
Bodiesr separated, either of their own Accord, or
with an Addition of some scorisying Body, melt to-
gether into Glass, and thus join again in another
Manner? It will then be very wisely done, always to
be attentive to either of these Effects in any Operation
whatsoever, and to derive the Differences and Deuo-
minations of the Operations frorn the principal of the
said Effecls, and from thc Diverslty of the Apparatus
of the Instruments (Ch-ap. Il. &nd HI), by which the
Changes to he efferrem are made in the Objects
