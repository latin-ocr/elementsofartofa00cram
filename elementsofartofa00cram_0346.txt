“ two Centners of pure granulated Copper weigh 186 lb.
This has lost 14 lb by the Coppelling. If the Regu-
lus remaining of the black Copper weighs 154 lb.
you must of Course add 14 lb. to the 154 lb. thereby
to restitute as much Copper, as has been consumed
of your Copper by the same Lead, and in the same
Degree of Fire: The Sum 168 will indicate how·
many Pounds Weight of pure Copper may be ferched
out of the black one. But if the black Copper had
already some Lead in it; this being consumed, carries
away with it about the fifteenth or fixteenth Part of
the pure Copper, which must of Course be added
over and above. But you may take for the Qantity
of the Lead, the Difference of the Regulus's remain-
ing after the coppelling, Therefore in the Example
just proposed, the Difference between 186 and 154
will be 32: For which Reason you must add two
Pounds·, and the whole Weight will be 170 lb. This
Method proves more exa& than the foregoing.

‘she Use and Reafhns of the Proceſs.

1. This is the last purifying of Copper, whereby
the Separation of the heterogeneous Bodies begun
in the foregoing Proceffes‚ is completed as perfeffly
as it poffibly can be. For, except Gold and Silver,
all the other Metals and Semi-metals are partly diffi-
pated and partly burnt together with the Sulphur and
Arsenick: But, in the Fufion‚ they either turn of
themselves to Scoria or Fumes3 or this is performed
by Means of Iron, which chiefly absorbes Semi-metals‚
Sul phur and Arsenick, and the Destruftion of it is at the
same Time accelerated by them. Thus the Copper is
precipitated out of them pure: Forit is self-evident,that
the unmetallick Earth is expelled, the Copper being re-
duced from a vitrescent terrestrial to a metallick State,
and the Arsenick being diffipated‚ by Means of which
the said Earth has been chiefly joined to the coarser
Regulus’s of the first F ufion. But there is at the same
Time a good Quantity of the Copper that getsinto
