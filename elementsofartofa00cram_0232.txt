‘206 ‚c The ART of

Border of th'e Test. · Then the Surface of the Lead
will appear in the Middle of the Ί611, like a bright
Disc, and you will see 1t smoak and boil (Ibid § 38).
So soon as you see this, it will be proper to diminilh
the Fire a small Matter, sor a Qarter ofan Hour;
so as that the boilin 3 of the Lead may almost cease.
Then again, 111616116 1116 Fire to such a Degree,
that allU may turn into a thin Fluid, and the Lead
may be seen, as before, smoa king, and boiling with
great Violence : The Surfaee of it then will diminilh
by Degrees, and be covered over with a Mass of Sco-
ria's. Finally, have at Hand an iron-Hook (Part I.
Plat. IV. Fig. VI.) ready heated, wherewith the
whole Mass must be stirred, especially towards the
Border ·‚ that, in Case any small Parcels of the Ore
not yet dissolved should be adherent there, they may
be brought down, taking great Care, not to stirr any
the least Thing out of the Test.

4 Now, if what is adherent to the Hook during
the stirring, when you raise it above the Test, melts
quickly again, and the Extremity of 1116 Hook grown
60161 13 covered with a thin, smooth‚ shining Crust;
it is a Sign that the Scorification is perfet‘t· , and it
will be the more s0‚ as the said Crust adherent to the
Hook, [hall he coloured equally on every Side. But
in Case‚ while the Scoria’s are stirred, you perceive
any considerable Chmminess ’111 them, and when
they adhere in good Q ntity 1ο 1116 Hook though

quite red hot, and are inequally tinged, and seem ,

dusty, or 10113 qh with Gmins interspersed here and
there, it 13 3 Sign that the 016 13 1101 entirely turned
to 86011·1’3. Ι11ῠ11113 Case, you rnust with a Hammer
strike off wha t is adnerent 10 the Hook, pulverize
it, and, with a Ladle (ibid. Plat. IV. Fig. XI), put
it again 11110 1116 Test, without any Loss or Mixture
of any foreign Body, and continue the Fire in the
same Degree, till the Scoria has acquired its Perfe-
811011 and the above· mentioned anlities. This once
obtained, take the Test wit h a Ρ111· of Tongs (zhic'l.

together
