121. common Aqua Fortis, when poured upon
Szlver, most generally grows troubled, in. the begin-
ning of the Diffolution ς and a little after it is per-
fest, a Precipitation of a whitilh Powder is made.
If this Powcler, taken by itself‚ melts in the Fire
with Pet-ashes, you find at the Bottom of the Veffel
a Regulus of Silver colle&ed. This sometimes melts
with Difficulty on the Fire5 and has all the Charafte-
fisticks of Culx of Silver precipitated from Aqua For-
tis by Oil of Vitriol. This certainly happens, be-
cause the Aqua Fortis has been extraoed by too great
and too long a Fire, or because too great a Qantity
of calcined Vitriol has been used, or in short because
the mutual Mixture of the Vitriol and Nure, has not
been rightly made: For in these Cales, there appear,
when the Distillation draws at an end, opaque,
milky, vitriolick Fumes in the Recipient: Which
· Phenomenon sufficiently evidences the Cause of the
aforesaid Precipitation. The abovementioned calx
very seldom proves Fluid in the Fire·, it after-
wards turns into ku-deer, and shews that the im-
pure Nitre bought for the Distillation of the Aqua
Fortis was intermixed with marine Salt.

that by which Gold is separated from Silver with Aqua

sortis, is confi lei bly hindered and made uncertain
by this Kind of Precipitation (ᾗ 121. ); that Part of
Ozl or [surum and of Spu-it of Sale which spoils the
Aqua Fortis, must be separated: Which is done hm the
following Manner. They pour one 30th or 40 Part
