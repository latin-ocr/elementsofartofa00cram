ASSAYING METALS'. 405
3. The Regulus of A'rsenick is very difficultly got:
without any Addition. For, every reducing Flux
is very refratstory‚ with regard to the great Volatility
of this Regulus, so that it is most quickly diffipated
by the same Fire that melts it, and then either clis-
appears intirely‚ or adheres dispersed among the
Scoria's to small shining spungy Maffes : Which hap-
pens also‚ When there is not the Degree of Fire nez
ceffary for the Fufion of the Flux. There is also a
great Deal of the Arsenick that remains in the Sco-
ria's, totally diffolved‚ ,and not apparent at all. For
this Reason, there must be much more Arsenick than
Flux, and they must b'e mixt together by Trituraa
tion·, the strieten the better. Arsenick may be pro-
duced under a semi-metallick Form‚ out of the same
Mixture of Flux and Arsenick, by a strong Subli-
mation ε This may be done very conveniently with
a small Earthen Cucurbste, to which another of Glasa
must be applied : This must by all Means be hori-
zontally fituated in a Furnace fit to make Distillatie·

4. Let Arsenick be reduced to a semi-metallick
Form‚ by whatever Method you will, according to
the foregoing Diraffions, it will reaffume its white

crystalline Form‚ by a Sublimation with fixt Alkali5
or Mercury (Proc. LXXI.)
