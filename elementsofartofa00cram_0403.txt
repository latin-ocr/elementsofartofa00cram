bility remaining perse& in the Cold : But the more
it grows hot in the F ire, the more brittle it becomes ·,
so that, when it grows middling red-hot, you will
eafily break it into small Bits with a wooden Manet,

or if it is handled rougffly, having then lost all its ,

Tenacity.
2. If Calamine, or any other Body containing

Zink, and to be tried by this Method, is full ofa
great Qantity of Lead‚ or of some other Metal not
separable from it; it is proper, that the Mixture of
it with pulverized Charcoal made as before (ΝΟ. 1),
be ground very fine, that some Lute be mixt with it,
and that it be strongly compacted and crammed into
a melting Veffel, to the End that the Plates of Cop..
per put at Top being melted, they may not get to
the Bottom : Then, you must put a good Qantity

of Charcoal-dust upon your Plates of Copper, and ’

do the Rest as before: Likewise‚ melt the Copper in a
Fire much gentler than when it is alone, and it will
be 'tinged‚ though with a Colour sornewhat paler,
nor will the Weight of it be so much increased.

The Ufi and Reasons of the Procassr.

1. In this Process the Copper Is penetrated by the
Zink, in form of a Vapour, and the Zink is fixt
in it: Which plainly appears, because when you
stop the Pafl'age of the Copper, by putting Lute be-
tween, to keep it from running down into the Mix-
ture at the Bottom of the Veffel, nevertheless its Con-
fistence, Colour, and Constitution change in the F ire,
and its Weight increases, in so much that it is certain
that the sublimed Matter has produced these Effeci&
The Charcoal-dust does also prevent the burning of
the Copper, and hinders the Zink received by it:
from being again burnt and diffipated. For,. if you
melt tinged Copper in a Crucible, without any Ad-
dition, it takes a bright Flame almost like Zink it-
self, and spreads Abundance of white F lowers tinged

here and there with a Citron·colour‚ which seems tg
