fourth Chamber of the Fornace: But, it will not be

’ altogether free from Lead.
The Calx’s of G-old and Silver are prepared by Solu-

·tion in their proper aeid Menstrua3 from which they
are separated by extraffion of the Spirits‚ or by pre-
cipitation with othenMetals or Salts. Mean while,
be aware of fulminating, Gold. Calx of Gold pre—
cipitated out of Aqua Regis by Tin, is called Cala:
Caffii. Mercury itself being corroded by Aqua Feriis
and Oil of Vitriol‚ i‘s rendered more fixc, and when
inspiffated, it is sometimes added 'oy Artificem, to
Compofitions of Calxs for tinging of GlaffeS. Semi-

’ metals are calcined by themselves, which is easily

done chiefly with Regulus of Anffimony, or diffolved
by Acids, and precipitated several “Waysz Nay‚ when

’ prepared with Nitre by Detonation‚ they may enter

into the Compofition of Glaffes.

Having prepared these Calxs, you will' be able to
tinge Glaffes in a Multitude of Manners 3 especially
if they are at the sffme Time accompanied with some

other BodieS.
Observe in general. 1. Y'ou must put your Mix-¹

ture either in a new Veffel, or at least in a Veffelin Δ

which Glass has been in the same Manner coloured,
worked, melted‚ and taken out. 2. The thicker
‚Bits of Glass require less of the tingent Calxs, and the
thinner Ones require more. 3„ Use a Fire of such a
Strength, as that a warni Tobacco-pipe being intro-
duced into it, there may indeed adhere to it a pretty
thick Crust·‚' but not a large Knob of Glass: Nor
must the Mixture be put at once into the Veffels ·,
but when part of it is thoroughly melted‚ the rest
may be put gradually into the Veffel with a small
iron-Ladle: For some Mixtures are very apt to foam:
Ofwhich we shall soon give ExampleS.

1. The green Colour is made of two Ounces of the
Mixture for crystalline Glass‚ to which you are to
mix about ten Grains ofany Copper whatsoever‚ ,or ·
of Brass : If you add to the Calx of Copper a few

Graius of Crocus of Iron, you will have the grege
