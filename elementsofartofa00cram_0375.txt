ria's, and the Mass being grown solid, put it upon an
Anvil, and with a Hammer divide it into two Parts,
which must be extended into long Barrs by being·
made red hot, and hammered several Times over:
Then extinguish them in cold water, whereby they
are rendered so very hard, that they will fly asun-
der when struck with great Force, and will not be
filable 3 which shews that the Operation has been well
made. But, if you have a Mind at the first Time to
change Iron-Ore or crude Iron into Steel, nothing but
a Repetition ofTrials will inform you, how long andi
at how many Times the Matter in Hand must be.
melted‚ made red hot, and hammered. For, there
are Ores, which, by a first Fufion, produce Maffes
which are intermediate between malleable Iron and
Steel·, or resemble Steel that is but half-worked:
Whence such Steel—Ores are commonly called by the
Germans ³²* sstaijlssstein. Other Ores, on the con-
trary, must often go through a Number of long·
lasting Fufions and Hammerings, and sometimes lose
half the Weight of the crude Iron in the first Fufion,
and yet never yield a right Kind of Steel. But, it is
easy to guess at the Reason, why this Process is very
much forwarded, when you now and then add to

. your burning Coals, a fat, oily‚ and fixt Fewel,

taken out of the animal or the vegetable Kingdom ε
For, the Metal must be penetrated by the Phogiston,
and receive it both in great Plenty and very inti-
mately: While, at the same Time, the terrestrial
and sulphureous PartIcles which render the Iron crude
and brittle, are diffipated: For, the abovementioned
F ewel produces Nothing of these Matters, but only

' constantly supplies a Phlogiston destitute of Acid of

Sulphur. Take Care, on the contrary, not to torture
your Metal with too violent, too long, and too dry
a Fire, nor with an exceffive Blast of Wind: Other-
wisc, you would in vain expect the defired Change.
