P R O C E S S XXXVIII.
To precipitate Copper out of an Ore (PrOC. XXXVII.)

that contains I ron.

APPARATUS.

1. O all according to Proc. XXXVII. But

you will find, after the Veffel is broken, a
Regulus upon no Account so fine, but less ὀυᾶἰΙε,
wherein the genuine Colour of the Copper does not
perfeffly appear, 'and which must be further
purified.

The Use and Reastms qf the Proccss.

The Fire used in this Operation, is not quite so
strong, as that the Iron may turn to a Regulus : Butas
Copper is the Menstruum of Iron,which is of itself very
refraftory in the Fire; for this Reason, while the
Ore and the F lux are most intimately mixt and con·
founded by Trituration‚ the greatest Part of the Iron
being diffolved by the Copper, turns into a Regulus
along with it.

PROCESS XXXIX.

The roasting of a pyritose‚ ffisphumus, arst‘nz‘cak fimi-

APPARATUS.

1. REAK two docimastical Centners of the

Ore to a coarse Powder, put them into a
Test covered with a Ti1e, and place them under the
Muffel of the docimastical Furnace : But the Fire
must be so gentle, as that the Muffel may be but
very faintly red hot. When the Ore has decrepi-
