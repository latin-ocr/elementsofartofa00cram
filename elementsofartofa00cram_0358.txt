51⁴ he Use and Reasons of the Proceſs,

1. Tin-Ore is never found charged with Sulphur,
but disposed into a State of Ore by Arsenick: It
is chiefly white, semidiaphanOUS‚ and on the Out-fide
resembles in some Measure Spaad‚ or the white Sta·
laffites, But the Sulphur, which is of a dark Colour
in Tin-ores, is hardly worth any Confideration with
regard to its Arsenick. Now, as Arsenick carries
away a great Deal of Tin by the Fire, and soon re-
solves Tin into Ashes, and destroys the rest of it,
reducing it to a brittle ssody, looking like a serni-
Metal ·‚ it is neceffary to free every Tin-ore from its
Arsenick‚ as perfeffly as poffible, by roasting. But c
the longer this Ore is in melting in a strong Fire, the
eafier a great Part of it is burnt, so as not to be re-
ducible, and so as to turn to a pretty refrastory
Scoria in a reducing Fire. Belides, Tin is never got
so good out of an Ore too long agitated by the Fire,
as when· the just Time and Strength of the Fire are
observed. The same may be experienced with some
of the best Tin already reduced: For the oftener it
is reduced and burnt to Ashes, or the longer the Affies
are tormented by a strong and pure mre, the worse
your Tin will constantly prove after the Redufflon.
