ASSAYING METALS. 171

cannot always b‘e distinguished so eafily 3 noy, they
commonly enough resemble the Ores ofother Met-als ; 2
and indeed sometimes carry Particles ofseveral Ores,
that have grown together with them. Nevertheless‚
as they contain Vitriol already pei-feet, the vitriolick
Taste is an infallible Charaeteristick of them all ·, so
that they immediately manifest themselves (ἓ 417.)
to the very first Taster that brings them to his
Li S..

522. We must also here speak of the sulphureous
Pyrites of Iron and Copper (ξ 316, 347, 369).
They certainly have in them all the Principles, that
may give Birth to Vitriol (§ 417), viz. Copper,
Iron, and the Aeicl of Sulphur. For some of the
Pyrites of Iron, being exposed in the Air, split of
their own Accord, and turn in part into Vitriol. Of
this kind are the pure, merely sulphureous (§316.) Py-
rites osIron: But the PyritesofCopper‚ even ofarseni-
cal (ᾗ 369, 323.) Copper, do hardly s0. The others
must be previously rousted, and exposed in the Air
for some Weeks or Months, to produce Vitriol. Of
this Kind are the Pyrites of Iron and Copper, and
those which have something arsenical in them, toge-
ther with Sulphur, as is observed by the illustrioris
Henckel. Nevertheless, you must make a great many
Experiments as to this ·, sor there are some Pyrites of
Iron, Which being exposed to the Ais, will not turn
into Vitriol of their own Accord 3 although *they do
not contain more Copper or Arsenick, than some
others, which turn into Vitriol in a few DayS.

423.There are also many Cal.11nine—Stones(§412)‚
which will produceVitriol, after a previous Roasting ς
though they are not of the Pyrites kind, and though
you cannot demonstrate by the Successof any Expe-
riments, that they contain as much Acid, as is neces-
sary for the Generation of the Vitriol that is got out
of them.
