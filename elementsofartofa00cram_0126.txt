docimastick Centners, or Drachm33 you must have
another somewhat stronger Balance‚ that may be

weigh the several Fluxes, the Additions‚ Lead and
Ores, especially those of Coppem Iron, Lead, Tin,

273. As many kinds of Weights are used by Ar·-
·tificers that work in Metals, to weigh them, so many
must the Affayer have at hand, because he is much
*more taken up with heis Art than any, and must not
be obliged to consume his Time in arithmetical Cal-
culations‚ for the Redufflon of his WeightS. But
the Weights which are properly called Affayer’zs
Weights‚ are a thousand times smaller than common
ones·‚ because, the Portions of Metals or of Ores
'examincd in docimastical Operations, are extremely
small,

274. The Metallurgists‚ who extract Metals out
of their Ores, use a Weight divided into a hundred
*equaLParts (they call them Pozmds) the whole of
which they call a Centner, or an hundred Weight.
The Pound is divided into thirty two Parts called
&aff-Omnes, (in Germanffssntlj) ·‚ ¹the half Ounce again,
·is divided into two eroers, and the Qarter into as
· ⁴{many Dmchms, called in German Quintlein. There
is hardly any further Subdivifion of the Weights,
used in large Works. However it is proper, that
the Assayer should also have a Drachm divided into
two equal Parts3 because he must sometimes have
regard to such minute Qantities. Finally‚ to be
able to weigh all the Parts of a Centnerjust mentioned,
you must have at hand as many different Weights, as
,are requisite‚ to compose from them each of the Pares
-of the Centner.
