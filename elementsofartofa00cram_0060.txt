44 The AM of

144. The very same Thing happens to Iron, which
being taken red hot out of the Fire, and rubbed with
Sulphur, melts immediately into a spongy DrosS. It
quits this Sulphur with great difficulty, but melts very
eafily with it: So that there is no Metal or Semi-
Metal that is so friendly to Sulphur as Iron.

145. Regulus of Antimony being well pulverised‚
mixed with Sulphur, melted, and stirred with a Hook,
turns into crude Antimony‚ the Fufion of which is like-
wise promoted by Brimstone. However‚ it is more
difficult than any of the foregoing to mix with Brim-
stone.

146. The same happens to Bismuth melted with
Brimstone over the Fire, as doth Regulus of Antimony
(ᾗ 145): Which however is a little ssower. Thence
a Mass is produced, like Antimony‚ of a faint grey
Colour, confisting of minute and very bright Needles
[Spiculi] cutting each other across,and extremely brittle,

147. Zink melted with Brimstone, mixes with it not
very easily ς but if remaining long in a moderate
F ire, it is covered over with Sulphur poured at seve-
ral Times upon it, and continually stirred with a
Poker, this at last produces a very brittle, dark-
coloured‚ shining Substance.

Coroll. 1. Therefore, Iron being very greedy of
Sulphur‚ all the other Metals and Semi-Metals may
be freed of Sulphur by it.

Coroll. 2. A very small Qantity of Iron, a greater
Qantity of Copper, and a confiderable deal of Lead
and -Tz'n, are necessary to absorbe the same Qantity
of Sulphur.

Coroll. 3. The reguline Part of Antimony is precipi-
tated from Sulphur, by Iron, Coppa, Leuci, ’Τ in, and
Silver.

Coroll. 4. The Scoriae swimming upon the Regulus
of Antimony made by the abovesaid five Metals
(Coroll. 3.) are more or less fufible, according as these
Metals melt more or less eafily with Sulphur in the
Fire : For the S corice of Regulus cffAntimony are nothing
but Sulphur ofAntimony mixed with precipitating Mle-
