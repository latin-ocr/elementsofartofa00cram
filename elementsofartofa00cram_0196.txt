trix impregnated with Nitre: nor is it even found
at so great a Depth, unless it has been by Waters
walhed off from its Matrix, and thus carried lower
down together with the said Waters: Which, ne·
vertheless, happens in this only Case, when the Soil
under it is chopped, or of a stony, porous Nature ;
because the Water itself can hardly penetrate above
two Foot deep into a great many Earths.

438. The chief Matrix of Nitre are calcareous‚
clayey, loomy Earths, and a kind of moist Earth
which has all its Origine from vegetable and animal
Bodies, destroyed by the Viciffitudes of the Air. If
there join to them Ashes of burnt Vegetables‚ espe-
cially of those out of which a great Deal offixt alka-
line Salt is ferched by Fire 3 if the said Ashes are not
quite deprived of their Salt by boiling : and if the
fat, oily, rottening, or already rotten Parts of the
said Animal, and vegetable Bodies are added3 then
a perfect Generation of Nitre is performed in the said
Matrix: for there is never any Nitre produced in
an Earth quite destitute of all Phlogiston ε you are
only to take care, heedlessy, not to mistake for Ni-
tre, the calcareous, stalaffical Efflorescencies, that are
found against Bridges and Walls.

439. Nor is it very important, where the already
mentioned (ᾗ 438.) Matrix of Nitre be placed : for
there never was yet any Place found unfit for the
Generation of Nitre, provided the abovesaid Bodies
(§ 438.) do concur to it. .However, it is requifite
that the Place be quite in the open Air, and tempe-
rate as to Moisture and Dryness: for an exceffive
Humidity washes off the Nitre already conceived,
and when a diluting Moisture is altogether deficient,

, the saline Matters hardly 361 one upon another. In

the mean Time, it is certain that Heat and Cold are
here neither much useful nor noxious, unless both be
very exceffive. However, the greatest Heat of the
Sun is to be avoided.

Coroll. It is plain, from what has (ξ 437—439.)

already been said, that Nitre may be ingendered ilrl1
