Assmme METALS. 21

. OfGoto and SILVER

63. Gold and Silver mutually melt with one ano-
¹ther3 and are befides easily mix 'd with Iron. As to
,εἰπάν other Properties‚ I shall refer you back to what
has already been said„

Of IRON.

64. See what was said before. However, it is ob·
servable that Iron must be extremely pure in these
Mixtute33 for is 1t contains too much Sulphur, the
melting does not succeed so well; and the Iron ga-
thers into a Regulus separated frorn the other Metals

Of MERCURY.

65. Mercury mixes with Gold, Silver‚ Lead, Tin,
Zink, ancl Bismuth; but not quite so eafily with Cop

Quantity of Metal is diffolved in Mercm), they
thicken into a kind of Paste. But the following
Conditions are required, for the quick and good Suc-
cess of these Mixtures.

First, That the Metal be comminuted‚ which may
be done any way, provided there is no Alcali in the
Operation ς because this either retards, or totally hin-
ders the At‘tion of the Mercury.

Secondgy, That a mechanical Mixture be employed
by grinding in a Mortar.

Thirdly, That the Heat be as great as the Mercury
can bear withoutbeing diffipated.

Fourthl), That the Surface ofl the Metal be very
clean, and above all free fron] all greafiness.

66. But there is a greater or les 5 Quantity of the
said Metals diffolved, according as the Conditions al-
ready mentioned are not wanting, and the Pureness of
the Mercury is greater or less.

67. However, you must take care, that a Part of
the diffolved Metal be so perfeffly attenuated by the
Mercury, that it may insinuate through the Potes of
a Filtre, as Snt diffolved in Χ sate. Howevet· it is
