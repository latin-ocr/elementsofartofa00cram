*ASSAYINGME'fiALsss 153

mic'al Analysis shew. It contains above three quar-
ter Parts ofSilver.

386. The horny silver-Ore is half transparent, it
is ofa deeper or lighter yellow or brown Colour‚ ac-
cording as it confists of larger or smaller Lumps, it -
looks like Rolin, and has an irregular F igure on the
Outfide 3 but When examined closely within, it ap-
pears to consist of very thin Plates. Nor is it very
ponderouS‚ nor hard, but easy to be ground : when
brought suddenly to the Fire‚ it crackles‚ bursts at a
great Distance‚ as most Ores do, and in this Case
exhales a sulphureous Smell‚ and sometimes burns
lightly‚ and finally casts forth something arsenical‚
but in a very small Qantity. On this Account‚ it
seems to differ from the foregoing (ᾗ 385), at least
with regard to the Qiantity of Sulphur. For it
hardly contains two thirds of Silver in it.

387. The red suver-Ore, is of a scarlet Colour,
sometimes lighter‚ sometimes deeper *3 in the first
Case, it is transparent like the arsenical Ruby 3 and
in the second Case, it is of a deeper Dye. It varies
its Figure, though it is often of the crystalline pris·
matical Form ·, it is heavier than the foregoing
(ξ 336.) hor-ny filver-Ore 3 but it bursts, when
brought near a Candle‚ or a mild Fire‚ and the re-
maining Part of it melrs immediately, before it grows
red hot ·, and then it emits the disagreeable Smell of
Arsenick, together with a thick visible Smoak : It
has something sulphureous in it, which is evidenced
by its burning violendy, and by the Smell of the
nitrous Acid, which rises from it when you sprinkle
upon it Nitre put in Fufion, and made red hot:³
which Phenomena are the Effeets neither of the Ar-
senick, nor of the Silver3 so that the scarlet Colour of
this Ore seems to proceed from this Cause (ᾗ 148.)
You may sometimes extra& with the Load-stone

·. ”⁵ Much resembling a Garnate‚ and hath by its outward Appear-
auce been mistaken for transparent cinnabar. See the Note (ᾗ 402 )
