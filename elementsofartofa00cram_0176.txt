158 The Am- of

399. No Ore, that I know, hath been hitherto
found, in which Gold constituted the greatest me-

,, tallick Part3 so that I cannot mention any Ore

(ὃ 311.) proper to Gold. The same is testified by
the Authors that are most skilful* in the Knowledge
and Trial of Minerals. There are indeed several
Ores sold under that Title3 but which, after a strift
Examination‚ are found not to be such; for in those
’ Places where Gold is washed out from Gravel and
Earths (§ 397.) you often find Tin Ores in Grains, as
likewise the Garnates mentioned (ξ 379—382.) In
which Case, the rapacious Iron-Ore, called in German
(353.) monitam, which is commonly joined to
these, is seldom wanting: Nay, it has sometimes
happened, that many People deceived by the red
yellowilh Colour of these Ores, looking as if there
was Gold in them, have mistaken thern for
golden Ores: Mean while, I never saw any Body
grow rich by Means of them, or any Gold melted
out of them. The same thing is to be concluded of
the Golden Marchafit553 so called because they are
nothing but sulphureous Ma7·chasstes† (§ 316.)

400. There are no Ores improper to Gold, but
Silver Ores ε For it is in these alone, that Gold pe-
netrated with Sulphur and Arsenick‚ has divested its
metallick Form. If Gold is found in other Ores,
there is a much greater Qantity of Silver joined to
it: So that they rather belong to the Class of the
Silver Ores; among which they have already been
reckoned.

Coroll. As Gold is most constant and incorruptible in
the Fire (ᾗ 6), its most subtle Particles are easily dis-

tinguished from Particles of the same Colour (ξ 3 16):
