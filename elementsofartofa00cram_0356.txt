330 The ART of

Lead, some crude Copper containing Iron, and
which is difficult to be run down either by itself
or with Lead‚ and this chiefly, when your Copper
is so rich in Silver and Gold, that it requires a con—
fiderable Addition of Lead for a sufficient Fufion.
Neither are you to add much less Lead to your Cop-
per than twice and a half the Qantity of it: Be-
cause, if you diminish the Proportion to an Excess,
there remains behind as much Lead‚ as is run off.
But, they most commonly add as many Portions of
Lead, weighing 17 lh. each, as there are half-
Ounces of Silver and Gold in the Mixture of Copper
and Lead‚ after the melting of them together: How÷
ever, you substract as much from these taken toge-
ther, as the Copper contained Lead before : By this
Means, you may separate out of one Centner of Cop-
per, one Ounoe, or even one half-Ounce of Silver.
Now, if there are in your Copper so many half-
Ounces of Silver, that as many Portions of seven-
teen Pounds weight of the superadded Lead, exceed
the quadruple Qantity of the Copper ·‚ this Copper
must be mixt with Copper that is poor, or made
such, to obtain a just Propordon, or it must go twice
through this ProcesS. But, when the Copper is rich,
and there are no Obstacles in other Respet‘tS, they
use Litharge in great Part instead of Lead, and sub-
stitute 125 lh. of it, for 1oo lh. of Lead ε For you
will get that Qantity of Lead from it by Reduction.
They even also take the Scoria's remaining in the
Tests‚ which differ from Litharge only in Purity,
and which pass through the reducing Furnace toge-
'ther with the Copper, while this is melted. The Cakes
or Loaves which are made of this Mixture, com·
monly do not contain above three Qarters of a
Centner of Copper, and two or three Centners of
Lead.

A great Qantity of Lead is melted out of these
Cakes, first by a gentle flaming Fim, and Silver is
afterwards separated from it in a Test. But the
Lead remaining of these Cakes is separated in a

Furnace‚
