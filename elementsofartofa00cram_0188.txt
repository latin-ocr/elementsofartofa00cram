neither within nor without, of the Figure it assumes
when crystalized according to Art. They have at
Gossar native white Vitriol of this Kind, which being
diffolved in Water, and inspissated again, pre-serves
its white Colour, and is found no where else, as I can
r remember. It contains Copper and Iron, and some-

thing besides, that is not metallicl<3 the Nature of
which is not yet thoroughly known. So that no
body, that l know, has been hitherto able to imitate
it so well, as that the artificia} one might not be dis- ’
tinguilhed from the natural. There are besides seve-
ral Germinations, and vitriolick Efflorescencies with-
in the Mines, and even in the Surface itself of the
Earth, they are sometimes of a dense Nature, some-
times woolly 3 they may be found white, green,

Colours, resulting from a fortuitous Mixture of he·

overlooked.

in German attamentxffitct‘n, are mineral Concretes,
in which the Vitriol already perse& (§417.) lies hid-
den, but confounded sometimes with many other
Earths and Minerals. W'hence it again easily ap-
pears, that the Diverfity of these Stones is infinite,
with regard to their Weight, HardnesS, Colour‚
&a and cannot be determined with Certainty. It
Jikewise follows hence, that the various Names, ta·
ken from these accidental DifferenceS, are altogether
useless, because all the Vitriols extraGoed out of any
one of these Bodies, and purified, are entirely the same
as that already (ᾗ 417.) mentioned. There are four
Species of these Stones chiefly recltoned, with regard
to the Difference of Colours: viz. the black, the grey,
the yellow‚ and the red ink—Stone. Among these, the
yellow-is very remarkable, by its most beautiful but
very decaying Colonr, by its soft Confistence, and

by the Qantity of Vitriol it contains. But the others
