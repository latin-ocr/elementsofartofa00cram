AssAYING METALS. ²23

Bed of Sand 3 that the Diffolution may be made by
a gentle Heat: This being perfect, put burning
Coals under it, that the boiling Diffolution may
thicken by Degrees ς till the remaining Mass be in-
tirely dry, of an affi-Colour, and hard: When, you
see it s0, then urge the Fire, till the Veffel grows
red-hot: Thus will the Oil of Vitriol be for the
greatest Part diffipated: But there will remain at
the Bottorn a pulverulent‚ dark red Caput Mortuum,
which must be taken out of the Vcffel, without lofing
any Thing of it.

2. Divide this into two equal Pam, and grind
each of them severally with a Centner of Glass of
Lead ε Put any one of these Mixtures‚ together with
eight Centners of granulated Lead, into a Test, and
compleat the Scorification, in the Manner described
in the third Process.

3. Burn off the remaining Regulus’s separately in
two Coppels, according to the second Process, and
weigh the remaining Beads of Silver: They will be
both of equal Weight. Then substraffl: the Silver
proceeding from the Lead added: ‘And thus you
will know, how much Silver may be fetched out of a
Centner of Iron.

Auother Method.

1. Put one Centner of comminuted Iron, and two
Centners of crude Antimony, into a small Crucible,
and ciose it with a Tile, and then put it into a strong
Fire, that it may melt: When it has been in a per-
fe& State of F ufion for five or eight Minutes‚ take
it out, that it may cool.

2. Break the Crucible when grown cold : You
will find Scoria’s at Top, and a Regulus underneath :
throw the first away, and pound the Regulus to a
fine Powder, and scorify it with twelve Centners of
Lead, upon a continual, though not over-strong
Fire ·, till you see the Lead quite covered with Sco-
ria's : Then pour it out into a F unnel 3 nor are you
