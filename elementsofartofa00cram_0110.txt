more remote however from the Bottom of the Cavity‚
without a Paffige at the other Extremity‚ and com-
municating only with the Cavity of the third Chim-
ney (5 5 5), which must be erested in the same Man-
ner as the two foregoing ones (qq qq· 2 2 2 2). Thus
you will have a Furnace very proper for a great many
()peradons.

243. We are now to speak of the use of the Atha-
κον just described (§ 242)·‚ and chiefly to mention,
to what Operations each of its Parts serve in particu-
lar, and then how the Fire may and must be governed
in it. 1. Yon must put at the upper arched Door (e)
ofthe lower within, a Semi-cylindrical Muffel twelve
Inches long, which must be introduced through the
Door: Which for this Reason must be of the same
Height and Breadth as that Door, three Qarters of an
Inch thick, and open behind, being ssiut there by
the hinder Part of the Athanor‚ as far as which it must
reach. For this purpose, a Tile must be set upon the
Grate (d) to support the Muffel. Let also this
Muffel have small Pieces cut out near its Bufis, as
common Affay-muli‘cls (Plan. ΙΙ. Fig. Ι. and ΙΙ.) You
may put under this Muffel your Cement Pots, or such
Bodies as must be calcined with a long violent Fire :
Which can be done without a Muffel‚ though not so
neatly. 2. In the first Chamber (Plat. IV. Fig.1.
h h h h i i) you may make q the most violent Distilla-
tions with an open Fire ε For Retorts or large Veffels
are introduced into it, after you have taken away the
Door (k k k), and are put either upon the Hearth it-
self of this Chamber‚ or upon a particular Support of
Stone. But you must place these Veffels in such man-
ner, that their Necks may easily pass through the
Hole (l) of the Door, when put on again : For
which Purpose, they chufe a Support sometimes
higher, sometimes lower, according to the different
Heights of the Veffels. When afterwards the Door is
put on again, and fastened with both its Bolts (n n),-
you must close with Lute all the Chincks which lio

open
