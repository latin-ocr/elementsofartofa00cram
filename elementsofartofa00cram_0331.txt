may se e the Ore perpetually smoak' ing a little: In the
mean T ime it is also proper, now and then to stir
it up with an Iron- hook: Ἰ he {hining Particles will
tssume a dark red or blaekish Colour. This done,
take out the Test, that it rmy grow cold; if the
small Grains are not melted, nor strongly adherent to
each other, hitherto all is well 3 but if they run into
one single Cake, the Process must be made again with
another Portion of the Ore, in a more gentle Fire.

2. When the Ore is grown cold, beat it to a Pow-
des somewhat finer, and roast it by the same Method
as before; then take it out, and if the Powder is not
melted yet, beat it again to a most subtil Powder ς
in this, you are to take care that nothing be lost.

3. Roast the Powcler a second Time in a Fire
somewhat stronger‚ bnt for a few Minutes only: If
you do not then find the Ore any Way inclined to
meir, add a little Tallow‚ and make it burn away
under the Muffle, and do the same another Time
again, till the Fire being very bright‚ you no longer
perceive any sulphureous, arsenical, unpleasant Smell‚
or any Smoak3 and there remains nothing but a thiu,

soft Powder5 of a dark red, or blackilh Colour.

the Proportion of their constituent Particles, so much

For instance, the more Copper there is in a Pyrstes,
the more it inclines to Colliquation. The more Sul-
phur and Arsenick it has ιη it, the more quiekly the
