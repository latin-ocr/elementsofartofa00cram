least Diminution in the Gold, whereby you may be
sure of the requifite Degree of Strength in your Aqua
For-tis.

125. Aqua Fortis is excellent, when it comes again
after having been by Fire expelled out of dissolved
Metal ·‚ because it may be almost entirely fetched out
of it byDistillation. In order to this‚you introduce into a
middle-fiz’d Glass-cucurbite, adapted to an Alernbeck.
with an Hole in it ·, one Pound or one half Pound of
the same Diffolution‚ and distil it in the Manner here-
after described in the Article of Utenfils, into a large
Recipient ς that the Drops may fall one after another
at the Interval of some Seconds : When the Phlegm
of what remains shall be drawn off to forne Ounces ;
let a like Qantity of a fresh Diffolution, gently
warmed, be put a·new into the Cucurbite, and be
drawn offagain·‚ and let the pouring on of the fresh
Diffolution be reiterated in the same Mamer, till it
is all grown thick. This must be done in a small
Cucurbite‚ several Times over; lest a large Vessel,

being over-charged with too great a Qantity of the
Diffolution, should burst all of a sudden, and the

Aqua Fortis and Metal be lost at once. When, af-
ter the extraffing of all the Phlegm, yellowish Fumes
begin to appear by increasing the Fire a little, let
a Drachm or half a Drachm of Suet be added, lest
the remaining Metal being dried up, should so strong-
ly adhere to the Sides of the Veffel, as that it could
not be taken off: And when at last the Mass shall
be quite dry, ‘ let it be put on the Fire‚ till it becomes
red hot. The Calx of Metal which remains attho
Bottom of the Cucurbite, must be collested, and
mclted with pot-ashes.

126. Spirit may be extra&ed out of common Sas't

is out of Nitre .· However, the Distillation of it re-
