The Ufh and Reasons (ff the Process.

1. Pure Copper, in whatsoever Qantity‚ fS ¹¹²-
*tirely coniumed by sixteen Ἱ’ xmes as much Lead. But
it is quite otherwise, when it is mixt with Silver:
For Copper :s the m01e defended by the Silver, in
Proportion as it is in leffer Qlantity mixt with Sil-
ver, and vm Vcrstz. For Instance‚ half an Ounce of
,(ἶορρει· 13 eonsumed in the Coppel by fixteen half-
O'unces of Lead : But‚if one half-Ounce of Coppel-
ῖς confounded in the Fire, with eight half-Ounces of
Silver‚ sixteen half-Ounces of Lead will never suffice,
to destroy the whole half-Ounce of Copper. Now,
if you have found out by Experiment‚ the least Qan-
tity of Lead that i5 sufficient, and repeat the Expe-
riment anew, with half an Ounce of Copper mixt:
‘so fixfteen half-Ounces of Silvcr ·, you will see, that
the same Qumtity of Lead, which in the first· Case
had the Power of comples-[ing the Purification of
the Silver‚ is by no Means sufficient, to convert the
whole Coppm- into Scoria ·, and that some more Lead
must be adem ; and so on.

2. Thence ymo may deri-ae the Reason why Silver
cannot he intirely freed from all Copper by copel-
]iog ? gemes, you will never buy any Leoni, that is
altogether void of Copper : For you will find in no
Pbce any Heap of the pus-cst leadOres, that are not
ssightly mixt with eopper-Ore‚ or pyrites. Now, the ’
μῑῑὲξῑ Separation of such a small Qantity of Cop->
per, which is indeed very difficolt, would never re· ⁷
pay the Charges of it·‚ wherefooe, it remains in
t} e Ι. ead, aiter this ismelted out ofthe Ote. There-
fore, x122h1110ever Q? ntity of Lead you may use for
tne Pax-ir‘xing of S1lve1 from Copper, there remains
always some mi m s< antity of the Ι atter adherent
