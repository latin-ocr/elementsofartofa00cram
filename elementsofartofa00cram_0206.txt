them the cold Surface of a solid Body‚ that they may
apply themselves to it, they are called Sublimates,
and the Operation itsels Sublimation: but they are
chiefly and especially called Sublimates, when they
Form a solid Crust3 and when they remain only un-
der the Form of a fine Powder‚ they are called
FlowerS. The Sublimation is performed either in
close Veffels (which Method is sufficiently explained
in almost all the Writings of Chemists), or in an
open Air‚ in which Case it is particularly called ei-
ther-Geber or Glauber's‚ Sublimation. Thelatter is
not indeed very common, but chiefly known among
Metallurgists, in most of the Operations of which it
is always made use. os, while these Vapours apply
themselves to the Walls and Funnels of Fumaces,
and form the Scurfs and Flowers os the Furnaces

Vefl'els‚ by the first Method (§ 461) 3 especially if
your glass-Vessels are capable of bearing the Fire:
But there* are many Foffils, which, though you use-
the violentest Fire, yet prove very refraftory in close¹
Veffels; so that you can do but very little, or even
nothing at all with them. They, on the contrary,
are by the second Method called Geber’S, presently
resolved into abundant Vapours, in an open Fire,
which must be blown very gently3 as it is easy to
experience in the Calamine, in the several Tutties,
and the like. But that this Sublimation may be made
perstffly, and the Flowers and Sublimates be exactly
collefted 3 a particular Apparatus is required, which
may be very conveniently made in the following
Manner: Instead of the Funn'el (ᾗ 239. N⁰ 4), PU?
upon the Cover of the melting Furnace a large earth-
en Por, not glazed within, of a round Figure, hav-
ing at Bottom four or five Holes almost one Inch in
diameter3 in such Manner, that the wide Orifice of
the said Pot inverted, may be received into the
Mouth os the Cover, and the Bottom of it look up-
wards : then put upon this Pot in an inverted Situa-
