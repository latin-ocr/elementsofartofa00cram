the Affi-hol'e. 4. Make above this Grate an Open-
ing circular at Top (e), six Inches high, seven
Inches broad, that may, as well as the Ash-hole
(N0 2), be opened and shut with an non-Door,
5. Adapt to the Top of the Tower an iron- Cover (s),
exceeding the Aperture of the Tower all round two
Ine-hes, and having a Handle, wherewith it may be
easily taken away, and put on again. Thus you are to
make the Furnace called in Latin Furmts primarius.
6.Thencut out in any Side of the Tower, for Instance
in the left, an oblong squareAperture,going up oblique-
ly toward the outlicle (gg), four Inche>v and a half high,
ten Inches broad, having its inward inferior Edge,
one Inch and a half, or two Inches above the Grate
(d), that, by the intervening of this Hole, the Ca-
vit'y of this Tower may communicate with another
immediately to be described. 7. Nearly over-against
the same Side of the Tower, make a Cavity with
Stones, whose inferior Part must be a hollow Prism
(Plat. IV. Hg. Ι. h h h h), six Inches high, twelve
Inches broad, ending at Top in a Semi-cylindrical
Arch (i i) described by a Radius of six Inches 3 that
by this Meam, the Height of the whole Cavity be
twelve Inches in the Middle. Let this anterior Ca·
vity be totally open, though, when requifite, to be
ssiut very close with an iron-Plate (k k k), whose in-
ward S'urface is to be constructed, in the same Manner
prescribed (Plat. ΙΙΙο Fig. VIII.) for the ssiding Door
of the melting Furnace, and then luted two Inches
thick within. Moreover, let there be in the Middle
of this Plate, a round Hole(Plat. IV. Fig. I. l), four
or five Inches in Diameter, and let the Circumference
of this Hole have an iron cylindrical Border made to
it, and prominent within 3 that by means of it, the
Lining of Lute within may be supported, and kept
from falling down easily. Let a Notch one Inch
broad, and two Inches deep, be made in the outward
Circuit of the Aperture of this Cavity, to receive the
Extremity of the Plate that shuts the Aperture. The
Hole of this Plate (l) either is shut with a Stopple
