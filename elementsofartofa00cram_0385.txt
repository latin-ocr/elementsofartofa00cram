AssAYING METALS. 359

The Uſse and Reasons ofthe Procqſs.

1. No Roasting requires 10 great a Patience as that

of Antimony loaded withSulphur. For, the re ou- ,

line Part of it is, by th e mineral Sulphur, rendered the
mostfufibleofallMetals ¹mdSemi· metals‚ Ariiniek ‹x-
cepted· . But, if 1t melts, then a further ³Exhalation of
the Sulphur cannot be procurcd by continuing the
Firc, otherwise than by a great Loss of the Regulus
itself, · which being not of itself very well fixt in the
Fire‚ is the more easily carried away by the Sulphur
joined to it, so that it will be entirely diffipated along
with it, though it is at least above three Times the
Qantity of the Sulphur Therefore‚ you must roast
but a small Qantity of it at once, and extend it
wide, and stir it perpetually: Because, when it is
too finely pulverized, or heaped up only a few Lines
thick, it will not be seen to exhale any Thing, unless.
you stir it, though it already begins to melt at Bottom.
For, the Vapours of the Sulphur paffing through the
interstices of the less hotPowder which is upon them,
condensate : Whereby the Powder becomes of a yellow
Colour. The Roasting is done a little more eafily
without adding any Thing to the Ore of Antimony, ·
especially if you prevent t>the Melting in the Regin
ning As for the Rest, this Methodis hardly made
use Dof, except when you have a Mind to make com-
mon Glass of Antimony, which is made with the
already prepared calx of crude Antimony. For In-
stance, you put this calx in a strong compa& Cru—
eible, and make your Fire gradually, leaving the
Veffel open in the Beginning, · that the Sulphur still
remaining, may be entirely expe etlled Then incre ale
the Fire, ΖΒῑίΙΙ the Ore melts, theVeffel being covered,
to keep the Charcoal froni falling 1nt0 it, which re-
duces Glass to a regul ine semi· metallick Substance.
When melted, leave it so for a Qiaiter of an Hou. ‚
or longer, if the Veffels can bear it: Then at last,
pour it out upon a flat, dry, warni Stone: It will
be a Glass more or less transparent, and of a deep
