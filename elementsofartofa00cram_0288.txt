'262 The ART of

PROCESS xxm
'To stparate Gold from Silver with Aqua Fortis.

APPARATUS.

1- S Aq ua Fortis cannot corrode Silver off from

Gold‚ unless the former be three Times m
gree te1 Qa ntity than the latter (Part Ι. §472);
it is not every Mixture of- Gold and Silver that can be
separated by Aq ια I ο] tis. Let therefore the Mixture
ofthe white Aliay be purified m a Coppel from the
other Metals, if there is any in it; and be tried with
the Needles (Part I. § 295). If the Allay of it is
such, that it contains fix Carats or less of Gold‚ and
eighteen or more of Silver ·, you may reckon it fit to
make a Separation with Aqua Famis: 1f not, you
must either add a sufficient (Qantity of Silver by
melting together in the Fire, or make the Separation
with Aqua Regis, according to the foregoing Pro·
cess,

2. Now, if the Mixture is so allayed, as to admit
of the Action of Aqua Fortis3 reduce it to small
Plate53 put it into a small Cucurbite‚ and pour upon
it a double Qantity of Aqua Fortis, of a proper
Strength‚ and tried, that the least Qantity of Silver
rnay not be precipitated out of it(Part Ι. § 121, 122)s;
then put it in a warm Place, with a proper Cove'r.
If the Bubbles and red Smoak which are produced
during the Diss'oiutiom snake you think that the
Silver is corroded‚ decant the Solution, while it is
yet warni, into another glassV essel, and pour upon
what remains fresh Aqua Fortis, but in Qautity
twice as little as the first Time: Expose it agam to
the Fire, to rnal e it boil; then decant 1t again warni,
and repeat this once mox ·;e then wash the Refidue
with fresh W ater· ‚ which will be your Gold‚ ofa
dark colour, light, spungy, and brittle‚ out Of
which the Sissver is corroded,
