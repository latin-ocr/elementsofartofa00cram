AssAYING METALS. 173

427. It osten happen3‚ that, while the Pyrites is
preparing for the Generation of Vitriol (ξ 422.) a
considerable Qantity of Allom comes along toge..
ther with the Vitriol 3 which may commonly be ob-
served in inlz-Stones (§ 421) ·‚ as these often deposite
Vitriol and Allom together, by pouring Water upon

Α thern ς which however is not common to them all.

428. New, pure, aluminous MineraIS‚ which are
not of the Pyrite kind, when chemically examined‚
yield but very little of the Acid of Allom, or none
at all, or at least not a Qiantity answering to that of
the Allom gotten out of them, after they have been
a while exposed to the Air. Nor can one see the
Earth contained in these Minerals‚ which remains
after the burning (ᾗ 424.)οἷ the Allom. The crude Ca-
lamine (ξ 412, 423.) likewise when it is pure, not
mixt with any Pyrites‚ nor accompanied with any
steel-grained lead-Ore, appears to contain these Prin-
ciples in a much less Quantity. Nor indeed is there
any metallici< or unmetallick Earth in this Stone,
like the Caput Mortuum of (ᾗ 424.) Allom. But if
we mnst believe that it contains Acid in reality3 it is
hardly conceivable‚ how it can lie so much concealed
therein. Now we leave it to the Judgment and Ex-
perience of every body, to determine whether the
Acid of Allom, carried by the Air, is thus deposited
in the Matrix of the Allom, according to the Opi-
nion of the illnstrious F. Hqffmczn ³, or if the new Ge-
neration of the two Principles οἴ Allom, that is of
the terrestrial and the saline Acids (ξ 424.) is made by
Means of the Ais, or of the Fire‚ or of both toge-
ther, as is thought 'oy Hemleel ¹³ 3 but, as it is hardly
poffible to have an accurate Notion of this Matter,
before we know the OperationS, we ssmll have Oc-
caston to treat of these Things more at large, when
we come to our praffical Part.
