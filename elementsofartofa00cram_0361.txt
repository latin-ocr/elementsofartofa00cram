Tin itself : For, the terrestrial adherent Particles, are
separated with greater Care, and rnore perfeffly from
the tin-Ore, than from the others (Prae. L). Ne-
vertheless, you may know fron] the perfect or in]-
perfect saline Scoria, from the small metallick Grains
dispersed among the Scoria, or even from the very
Scoria proceeding from the destroyed Metal, which
may be reduced again, but chiefly from that part next
the metallick Regulus, whether a great Fault has

been committed. Therefore, the Examination of

the tin-Ore is better done by the following Method.

APPARATUS.

1. HUSE a large ἦ thick, extinguished‚ and

well burnt Coal of soft Wood, not very fi-
brous, nor crackling in the Fire, such as lime-tree or
hasse·t1·ee Wood : Make the largest Snrface of it flat
and smooth with a Knife. Excavate in that Plane a
Channel open in the fore-Part and above, beginning
at the Side and reaching to the Midclle of the Plane ε

Make a small pretty deep Pit at the hinder Extre-.

mity of this Channel z But, the Capacity of both the
Channel and the Pit must be so great, as that some
docimastical Centners of the Ore, may hardly fill
the third Part of both.

2. Pur into the above-described Channel (Νο. 1.)
two clocimastical Centners of tin-Ore, well prepared,
and beaten to a most subtile Powder, with a little
ofcommon Pitch, and let thern be spread so wide,
that the Ore thus heaped up, may no where come
up to the Height of the Channel. Put upon this
Coal another, of equal Length and Breadth‚ and
made smooth in such Manner 3 that the Channel and
