Assmme META'Ls. 3¹5

F irc. Put them into a Crucible or Pot3 and cover
them over with common Salt‚ shntting the Veffel
close with a Ti1e, and stopping the Joints with
Lugelf these Things melt in the Wind-furnace‚ by

Means of a violent fise, *you will find at the Bottom
of the Veffel a Regulus like that of Proc. XLI.

Τ he Use and Reasons of the Procejfs.

1. No sulphureous Ore that has not been
roasted‚ ought to be melted by adding to it an al-
caline ‘'Flux: For, fixt Alcali together with mine-.
ral Sulphur, turns to a Body, called Hepur Sulphuris,
which retains in it diffolved metallick Bodies
(Partl. ᾗ 149.): For this Reason‚ if you melt in the
Fire an Ore containing a great Deal of Sulphur, ‘or
of the Acid of it, with a black ora white Flux of
an alcaline oily Nature3 you either have no Regulus
at all, or at least the greatest Part of it is detained
in the Scoria's, that is, according as there is in the
Ore a greater or a less Qantity of the Metal to be
precipitated. If the Ore is mixt with Glass-gall, and
exposed to a melting F ire, the Regulus is easily pre·
cipitated out of this most fusible Salt: But this Re-
gulus most commonly retains the Colour of the Pyri-
tes itself, and when exposed to the Air in a Ihort
Time turns to a brown and very salt Powder ; which
ssiews that a great Qantity of Salt has mixt to it:
Nor is the Scoria that swims a-top destitute of Metal,
which renders both the Weight and Qality of the
Regulus uncertain.

2. This Mixture of Sulphur with 0in alcaline
Matters‚ most commonly must be acknowledged to
be an acceffory Reason, why the Ore melted in close
vessels, or the Metal itself, when mixt with Sul-
phm, afford a leffer Qantity of pure Metal, than
when the melting is performed in an open F ire 3 un-
less some precipitating Metal is added: As, for In-
stmce, Iron in the melting of Lead: But this does
