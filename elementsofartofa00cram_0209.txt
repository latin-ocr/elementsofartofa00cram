ASSAYING METALS, 191

tion by Fufion‚ in German Ξῖΐῦῑίῑεηε &meinung *-
The inferior, heavier Part is called Regulus.

467. This Operation (ξ 466.) almost always rem
quires the Addition of such Ingredients, as may
take away the mutual Connexion between the Parts
to be separated; that is, the menstrual virtue, by
Means of which one keeps the other in a State of
Difl‘olution. For Instance, the reguline Part (ἓ 16.)
of Antimony, and mineral Sulphur (ᾧ 138.) dissolve
each other rnutually‚ and constitute crude Antimony
(§ 145) 3 nor can they be separated from each other
by Fire alone, without destroying the Regulus: But
if you add Iron, Copper, Silver, &a which are
more throughly penetrated by Sulphur (ξ 147. Co-
roll. 3), and are thus reduced to the State of Ore
(§ 332) 3 then the Regulus of Antimony is freed of
the Sulphur; and finks to the Bottom‚ as it is hea-
vier than the additional Bodies then joined to the
Sulphur. Such a Precipitation by Fufion, happens
in Vitrifications (ᾗ 451), Scorifications (ᾧ 452), and
Coppellings (ξ 454); while one Part turns into Glass
or Dross, the other metallick Part, if there is any,
keeping still its metallici< Form, is collefied at the
Bottom of the spherical V effel. Therefore‚ Silver
and Gold, which are hardly subje& to a perse& Vi-
trification, do constantly remam, and on this Ac-
count, though they were in ever so small a Qantity
in a Coppelling, they {hew themselves very clearly to
the Eye, when the Scoria is absorbed3 whereas so
small a Regulus of these Metals would have been as
it were buried and hidden under so great a Qantity
of Scoria. Nor is Precipitation by Fufion less ne-
cessary, to obtain almost all the other Metals‚ which
on this Account are called imperfcst3 unless, per-
›hapS‚ you except a very small Qiantity of native
*Metah which, nevertheless‚ can hardly be called
truly pure. Bcfides, they are all to be had either in

* That is dzgv Parting, or separating in a dry Ma nnnnn without
any fluid Menstruum.
