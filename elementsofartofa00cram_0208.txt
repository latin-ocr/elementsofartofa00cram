190 . They ART of

a F ire in the Beginning: to prevent this, they use
sometimes to add some fixing Body; of which we
shall speak in a more special Mamer, in its proper
Place.

465. Calcination differs little from masting
(ξ 463, 464), as to the Manner of operating, but
»only with regard to the Aim of it. For in Calcina-
tion (though this be often attended with the Diffipa-
tion of the Volatiles) they only have Regard to the
fine Comminuting of the Body. Therefore, by Means ,
of this Operation‚ the Body falls presently into Dust,
under the Fire itself of the Calcination, or at least
splits easily, when a moist Ais, or Water, comes af-
terwards in theWay ·‚ which happens in Lime-stones:
Another Effe& of Calcination is, that pliant Bodies
affume a brittle Texture, as may be observed in Me-
tals·‚ and that the hardest Bodies may be split, and
thus be afterwards more eafily broken in Pieces ε In
which Case, it is often useful all of a sudden to pour
cold Water upon calcined Bodies, even when they
are hot to the utmost Degree. You have Instances
of this in FlintS, &a Sometimes the Calcination is
better performed by adding certain Helps. Thus
Tin turns immediately to a Calx or to Ashes, by ad-
ding Lead to it, and by Means of a very strong
F ire.

Coroll. Thence it is plain, that you must use in
Calcination the same Manner of Operation‚ as in
roasting (§ 464) ·, because the former is performed by
the Separation of the volatile Bodies: Nevertheless‚
it is not so in otherS.

Scholion. Both [hest Operations (ξ 463, 465.) are
most commonly consoundecl wirla each other, on account of
their great Affinity3 so that sometimes calcination is
called Roosting, δε vice versa.

466. When any Part ofa compouud Body melting
in the Fire‚ is separated from the Rest‚ in such Man-
ner‚ that one Part finks to the Bottom‚ and the other
swirns at Top, this Operation is called Precipita-
