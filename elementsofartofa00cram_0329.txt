AssAriNG METALS. 303

PROCESS XXXVII.

To reduce and precipitate Copper ont φῖ Ores (psocj
XXXVI.) rendered rejfrafflory by Ecmh απτ] Stones
that cannot be wafhed (ff

APPARATUS.

1. E AT your Ore into a most subtil Powder, of
which weigh one or two Centners, and mix
as much glass- Gall to thern ε This done, add like-
wise four Times as much of the black F lux, with re-
spe& to the Ore : For, by this Means the steril ter-
restrial Parts are better disposed to a Scorification‚
and the reducing and precipitating Flux may ast
more freely upon the metallick Particles freed of
all their IncumbranceS. ’
2. As for the rest, make the Apparatus accord-
ing to Proc. XXXVI ; but you must make the Fire
a little stronger for about half an Hour together.

When the Vessel is grown cold, and broken, exa· ’

mine the seori-ss, whether they are as they ought
to be : The Regulus will be as dustil and fine as the
foregoing.

The Use and Reasons of the Process.

1. Every Thing has been already explained in
Proc. XXXIII : But as such copper-Ores hardly con·
ceal any Sulphurand Arsenick in them, the Roasting
would be of no Effe& and a great Deal of Copper
would be lost : For no metallick Calx, except those
of Gold and Silver‚ improperly so called, can be
roasted, without you find a Part of the Metal lost
after the Redufftion : But the Stones which here are

supposed not to be elutriable‚ cannot be separated
by Fire alone ε See Par! I. ᾗ 338.
