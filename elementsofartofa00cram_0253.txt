AssAYING‘ METALs. 227

per wrapt up in a small Paper, so that it may be im-
mersed into the Middle of the boiling Lead ε This
preserves the Copper which adheres to the Border,
from being difficultly‚ or even not dissolved at all.

2. When all the Copper is dissolved‚ suppress the
F ire, till you see on the Surface a Smoak wandering
here and there like melted Metal, and the metallick
Mass not very high nor bright, but low, moderately
white, and the Coppel brown, as far as it has been
penetrated by the Litharge. However, take Care
that the Ebullition of the Lead does not cease intire-
ly: For it is a very good Indication of the Degree
'of the Fire. If you employ too great a Fire‚ you
will certainly lose some of your Silver·, especially,
if you are not provided with the best Coppels.

3. When you see the greatest Part of the Metal
already consumed‚ increase the Fire gradually, and
make it pretty strong towards the End, that it may
burn quite bright and clear. Then take out the.
Coppel ; and if the Operation has been rightly made,
you will find the Bead of Silver, if there was any in the
Copper, quite bright, and surrounded with bright
Scoria's of a yellow Colour, in Form of Crystals.
The Coppel is always tinged with a dark Colour.
But if you perceive the Grains of Silver, either quite
dark, or only the Surface ofit tarnished with dark-
coloured Scales·, it is a Sgn, that there is still a great
Deal of Copper mixt with it: Which must be attri-
buted to the Defcst of the Fire or of the Lead, or to
the too late Immersion of the Copper into the boiling
Lead: For then a considerable Part of the Lead be-
ing consumed‚ the remaining Part has not the Power
of consuming the Copper sufficiently. But if all the
Scoria is intirely vanilhed, you have used too great a
Fire in the Middle and towards the End of the Cop-
pelling: In which Case, you must, for the greater
Security, repeat the Process-
