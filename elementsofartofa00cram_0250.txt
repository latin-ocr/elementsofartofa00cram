224 The ART os

to take so much Notice of the Scoria’s‚ as of the Re-
gulus 3 which must be tough, and of a light lead-
Colour within and without. If it proves blackish
and brittle, it then is not fit yet to be put into the
the CoppeL but it must be put into the Test a second
Time, and the Scorification be repeated ε Thus will
all the Antimony be at last consumed.

3. Let the Coppelling be performed, as in the se-
cond ProcesS.

T he Use and Reasons of the Procesr.

1. Iron, in its metallick State, yields neither to
Lead nor to Glass of Lead. But when it is destroyed
by the Privation of its Phlogiston, and disposed for
a Vitrification‚ it is easily diffolved by the Scoria or
the Glass of Lead 3 and melts together with it into a
thinly fiuid black Glass. He therefore that attempts
a Scorification‚ must previoussy pound this Glass very
fine, because this promotes very much the Diffipa-
tion of the Phlogiston ·‚ which is eafily obtained by
aeid Spirits diffolving Iron 3 but most perfeffly by
Oil of Vitriol: For this deprives Iron of Part of its
Phlogiston‚ during the Solution itself: As we may
see from the inflammable Spirit that rushes out, and
is produced in the actual Solution not only of Iron,
but also of Copper and Zink. The same Comminu-
tion and Destruction of Iron, is also performed with
Sulphur, if this is mixt with Filings of Iron, and
melted first in a close Test by a gentle Heat‚ and
finally burnt intirely in a stronger Fire : But the Dis-
solutionis never made so perfect thus, as by the first
Methods: For the Sulphur is much sooner burm, be-
fore it can sufficiently penetrate the Iron. Sulphur
poured upon red—hot F ilings‚ diffolves them indeed ;
but then it can hardly be taken out of the Vessels ·,
on which Account it is not rendered so proper for a
Scorification, as by the first Method, unless it be
beaten small and roasted a second Time z The very

same Operation is much better performed with alyel-
