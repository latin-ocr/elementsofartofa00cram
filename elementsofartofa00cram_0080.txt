64 77oe ΑΜ· of

(N0 1.) a thin Plate, with great Gaurion, lest it
should break >3 take it away, and having first smeerecl
it over with Bacon or Oil, clap it upon the convex'
Part of the Mould (Plat, Ι. Fig XIII.) 3. Then iri
the same Manner shut the hinder-Part of the said
Mould, with a like Lamina rnade Semi-circular, so
that the Border of this Lamina may be joined toge-
ther with the hinder-Border of the Lamina upon the
convex Part of (N0 2.) the Mould ·‚ which is ef-
fec‘ted with water, without which the hinder-Lamina
would not stick to the fore one. 4. By the same
Method, you may, if you think it proper, annex'
the Bottom to the inferior Edges of the above-mena
tioned two Lamiaa’s. Otherwise, you may leave'
the Botton] moveahle, making it of a small Lamina
cut off from the Cake : In which Cast, however, it
must by its Breadth exceed by half an Inch the Sides
and hinder-Part of the Muffel (No 2. and 3), that
the latter may 'with the greater Security stand upon
it as a BasiS. 5. Then with your Hand wer, rub the
Muffel thus made all over·, that the small Chinks
perhaps not seen, may by this Means be closed up
on every Side, and the (Ῑῖίι)1 closely joined to the
Mould. 6. When the Muffel applied to the Mould
has been for some Hours in the dry Ais, and it is
become hard, cut off from it some Pieces‚ in the
Manner aforesaid (ᾗ 196. cowll.) and (Plat. II. Fig.
Ι. and II.) which done, take the Mould softly away :
For if the Muffel should dry perfcffly upon it, it
would certainly crack. When afterwards the Muffel
exposed to the Air for some Days, is quite dried,
it is at last baked in a Potter's Ovem, or even in the
affay-Oven hereafter to be described 3 in such
Manner, nevertheless‚ that in the latter Case, the
Coals being lighted above first, may communicate
the Fire ssowly down to those underneath : Other*
wise, indeed the exceffive Force of the Fire would
certainly occasion Cracks in the Muffel. For which
Reason, it is much secures, to bake it in the first
Manner mentioned.
