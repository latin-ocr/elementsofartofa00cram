ASSAYING METALS. 261.

done, inspiffate the Liquors over a gentle Fire, till ’
they are dry : Put what remains into a Crucible, and
cover it with Powder of Borrae, melted before-hand
with a little Nitre ι Cover the Crucible close with a
Tile 3 and make the Melting first With a gentle, and
a little after with a great Fire. Then pour it into a
Mould to have an Ingot.

The remaining Calx of Silver being washed out
of the Cucurbite, by pouring WVater upon it, may In
, a wide Veffel be decanted, and being dried by Fire‚
may be melted in the sarne Manner.

The Ust' and Rectsons of the Proust.

1. All the Metals that are diffolved in Aqua Regis,
must be consumed by Coppelhng, before the Dino-
lution ·, lest being diffolved together with the Gold,
and inspiffated‚ they be again confounded with it:
But the small Qantity of Copper remaining after the
Coppelling (Proc. VIII. Uſs ΝΟ. 2), being much
divided by that Degree of Fire which puts Gold in
Fufion, is destroyed partly by itself‚ partly by the
Nitre, and turns to GlasS‚ and is received by the
SaltS.

2. Gold may be precipitated quicker out of its
Diffoludon, by a fixt or volatile Alkali: But the Calx
proceeding therefrom, which is of a dark yellow Co-
lour, being dried on a gentle Fire, becomes that kind
of Gold called AurumFulmincms, because,when theHeat
is not increased too suddenly but only by Degrees, it
decrepitates with great violence, and with a thunder·
ing Noise, and scatters every Thing round it with
such a Force as was hitherto never observed in any
other Body. We shall soon teach‚ how this ought
to be reduced, or rather separated from the SaltS‚
which produce this thunderingNoise together with it.
