A Method to file& Specimem out (gf Metals that have

been hosted, as well as out (gf thoe that are mellea?

together with Sulp >hur and Arst’nick‚ that there may
be the same Proportionof the Mixture s in the lats er as
there is in tle former

γλ Ῑ E have, in the foregoing process, explained {a

what: Manner Silver, together with t'he Goid
that lies hidden therein, may be separated from fo·
uio-n Bodies: But you cannot conclude otherwise
than hy pothetically from these Proceffes, how mu h
Silver and Gold may be fet‹:,hed out of a grea er
Qantity of the san. e Matter, from which you hwe
taken your Specimen for the docimastical Tria] . For
Iustance, whither there is the same Proportion of In-
gredients in a separate Specimen, as in the whole.
Mass to be tried. But such an equa] Union is not
always met with, in pure Metals confounded toge-
ther by the Fire: Which we have seen plainly
(Proc. X· Usj ΝΟ. 2)·‚ where Silver melted with
Lead‚ and left to itself‚ was not evenly diffolved by
the Lead, but the same Portion of the Mixture con·
tained more Silver at Top, and less uhderneath, and
Lead in an inverte-d Proportion. The same ming
happens likewise with Gold and Lead, and with Cop-
per and Lead : Unless you have Recourse to some
other manual Operation besides the Fire, in order to
obtain a more perfec} Mixture. Belides, it also de·
pends much from the greater or less Degree of the
Fire; which may increase, dinflnissa, or totally clis-
turb the Afflion of the Menstrua. Nay‚ the Mix-
ture of some Metals, for Instance of Gold, Silver⁹
and Copper, which eafily diffolve each other equally,
is so much troubled by the Addition of some other
Metal, sor Instance of Lead31hat an equal Pr o-
portion of th e Metals ις no longer preserved m evexy
