the Hammer any Way, some more, some less: By
which Qality it may be distinguished from crude

melted Iron : For this is often brittle, both when cold ··

and when hot, though it has not been extinguished in

Water. But, there area vast many Degrees in the Ι

hardening of Steel ε For, if it has been made too red-
hot‚ and is suddenly extinguifhed in eold Water in
Motion‚ it hardens more than if it had been but
‘faintly red, and cooled in warm Water. This Hard-
ening is caused by all such Bodies as suddenly absorb
the Heat, and at the same Time do not eafily pe-
netrate the Soeel, but change its Nature. Steel is
moreover of a darkerC010ur‚ and the Surface of it,
when broken, appears to confist ofsmaller granulated,
and even striated Particles, than the Iron which it is
made of: The Germans call it * ialatfiss‘e'zm'g, fflatss
βρείίῇς. But, this appears more distinCtly, when
Steel is welded to the same Kind of Iron, which it
was made of, and when the Mass made red-hot is
well incorporated together, by hammering: If then
you harden it again by extinguiffiing it in cold water,
and polish it, the Veins of Iron may be very well
distinguiffied from those of Steel : For, the Iron—ones
are more whitish, and almost of a Silver-colour, but
the Steel-ones ofa darker Dye, and almost ofthe Co-
lour of Water. For which Reason Dr. Stahl is ofOpi-
nion, that the Steel of Damascus, which hasthe same
Colour on the Cot-fide, is made in the fame Manner.
But, if such Steel mixt with Iron is broken, you may
likewise observe the Difference of the Largeness and
Colour of its Particles.

The Ufi’ and Reafhns of the Process.

Vapours to pure Iron, the rigid Body of which being-
mollifyed by the Heat‚ and made quite red hot, is pe-
netrated by the said VapourS, which then striffly
