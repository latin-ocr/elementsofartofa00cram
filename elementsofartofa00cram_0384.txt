Ore pulverized, half or an equal Qiantity of Char-
coal-dust‚ and perform the Rest as above, the Roast-
ing willbe done more conveniently ε For it does not
gather so eafily into Clots‚ and melts with much

evaporated‚ add some Fat to it at several Times, as
in Proc. XXXIX. ΝΟ. 3.

Thus, you will sooner finish the Operatiom and

strong Detonation will be made, and the Mixture
will be changed into a half-vitrified Mass, of the
Colour of Liver: Take it orit, grind it, and with
warrn Water wash off (Part I. §473. ἔθα.) the
Salt that lies hidden in it. The remaining Calx is
called Crocus Λκῖείαίίονιωι, or Hepar Antimom'i (Liver'
of Antimony.)
