The Uſs’ and Reasons of the Process.

1. The Ore of Antimony, which is always found
charged with Sulphur, is extremely fufible, and when
you continue too long a Fire that is somewhat too
strong, a great Quantity of it is lost in the Forrn of
Fumes: Nay‚ it burns very bright, on Account of
the Abundance of the mineral Sulphur, and it cannot
bear the saline reducing Fluxes (Part Ι. § 159, effe.)
Therefore, this Kind of Apparatus is required
for the running of it down, that the Aetion of the
Air may in forne Measure be stopt, and the Anti-
mony be in a cold Place so soon as it is melted:
This is done by the Ashes wherein the inferior Veffel
is immersed, which grow red-hot more difficultly
than other Bodies, which bear the Fire: Where-
fore, clry Baths are made with them rather than with
Sand or Filings of Iron, when too greata Heat may
be detrimental.

PROCESS LXI.

‘she Roasting of crude Antimony (Proc. LX.) or os ils
Ore, with, and without Additions.

APPARATUS.

1. H U S E an wrthen, flat, low Dish, not glazed,
and if it cannot bear being made middling

red hot, cover it over with a Coat of Lute without:
Spread it thinly over with crude Antimony, or with
its Ore, beaten to a pretty coarse Powder‚ not exceed-
ing a few Ounces at once. Put the Dish upon a
Fire-pan, having a erw burning Coals in it ; increase
the Firc, till it begins to smoak a little ε Mean while,
you rnust inceffantly move the Powder with a Piece
of a new Tobacco-pipe z For this causes the Sulphur
to evaporate the sooner. If you increase the Fire a
little too soon, the Powder· immediately gathers into
