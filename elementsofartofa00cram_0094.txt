2 3 3. That the Fire may be the better confined,¹
and the Iron not be destroyed by growing red hot,
· the 'whole Infide of the Furnace (ξ 232.) must be co-
vered over (See Plat. III. Fig. III. and IV.) with
Lute‚ one Ffflger, or one Finger and a half thick.
The Lute fit for this, is made with a Mass of Clay
(ξ 188, 190), or with French Clay‚ moistened with
three or four Times as much of Ox-Blood diluted
with water ᾖ. But before you cover the Infides of
your Furnace with this Lute, you must first put
within the Furnace small hon-Bam, equal in length
to the Diameter of the Oven, quadrangular‚ pris-
matical, halfan Inch thick, having their Extremities
supported by the Ledge (§ 232. N⁰ 9), and ξ of an
Inch distant from each other 3 and you must fasten
them so, that their flat Sides may be oblique with re-
gard to the transverse Section of the Furnace, and
that the two opposite Angles may look one upwards
and the other downwards, the Bars must not be laid
flat but edge—ways, by which Situation‚ you hindei·
the Ashes of the Fuel of the Fire from being detained-
too long, ‘between the Interstices of the said ison—Bam,
and from making an Obstruffion, that would oppose
the free Draught of the Air (See Plat. III. Fig IV).
The Furnace being then covered over with Lute,
and dried up by a gentle Heat, is at last fit for do·-
cimastical Operations‚ and especially for such as must
be performed in the Affay·oven (ἓ 194.)

³* The best Lute, and eafiest to be had at Lomhm, is a Sort of
clay called PVindfhr-Loam, which must be mixt pretty stiff, and
pressed into the Infide of the Fornace, first wetted with Water, aud
when the clay begins to dry, it must be beat down close to the Sides,
with a wooden Manet, then the Unevenness‘es and Cracks filled up
with fresh clay somewhat moister, so as to be made smooth and
even with aTrowel‚ and then left to dry gently, and if any Cracks
happen they must again be filled up. If any Pieces of this Lute are
broken off by the Fire; let it be quite cold and wer, the Edges of
the old Lute and fresh clay will unite to it, and fill up the Holes 3
if the Crack is but small, you may use the Furnace again immedi-
ately, even before the fresh Clay is dry.
