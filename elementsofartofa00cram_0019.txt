Scholion. The Operations hereafter to be made upon

Gold, and which Ifizppose are czsyet unknown to the Rea-
εἶεν, will give him cz more εκαὲῗ Idea of this Metal. Ῐ, may
stzy the same of the other Metals.

7. Silver, Luna (D) loses Τὶι- 01· ἶῖἷ of its weightin
Water: In Fire it is as fix’d as Gold, and melts in al-
most the same heat. Next to Gold itis infinitely rnal-
leable‚ and easy to be bent„ It refists the best Aqua
Regis, and is of the finest shining white.

8 Copper (ῼ) Venus, loses between ¹ and ¹ ofits
weight 1n the same Water. It is not very fix' dm
Fire, but loses a g¹e1t Part of its Substance, in Ex-
halation and Dross. It is likewise ma lleable, but
much less than the foregoing. It gives a loud Sound,
looks ofa deep yellow, is not fussble but by a great
Heat, and no sooner begins to whiten, but tinges the
Fire with a most beautiful blueiss] green. All Salts‚
and Things containing Salts, corrode it, when ap-
plied to it, in which case it affurnes τι great Variety of
Colours, especially the finest green or blue.

Scholion. Foffils are heresczid by me to be turned into
Scori‘e or Dross‚ if, when expostd to the Phe, they affume
the Form of Glafs3 a britti e Bod), fustble cmd fix’ d in
Fire, and zndiffoluhle b) Water.

9. Lead (b) Saturnus, loses between -- and -- of
its weight in Water. It melts long before it redd ens.
It 1 not fix’ d, but loses much of 1tst'Substance by Eva-
poration in a great Fire‚ and accmcling to the Degree
of Hem, turns entirely into a dusty or a vitresccnt
Dross, of a yellowilh Colour, called Litharge (Li-
thargyrizcm.) It is very tenacious‚ and the softcst of
Metals. lt gives hardly any Sound under the Ham-
mer, and 15 of a bluish white Colour.

lo. Tin, (4.), Jupzter‚ is the lightest ofall Metals
It loses ξ of its weight in VVaten It is not of a
fix' d Nature, b it melts m a mild Fire, long bel-ore
