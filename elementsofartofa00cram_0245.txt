themselves which are already subdued in part : When
you sce this, shut theVents of the Furnace, to diminilh
the F ire: Then gently touch this refractory Body,
With a small iron cold Hook, to which it will imme-
diately stick 3 take it off sostly, not tolose any Thing3
pound it into a fine Powder, adding a little of Glass
of Lead ·, and put it again into the Test, then con-
tinue the Scorification, till it is brought to its Perfe-
ction. But you must always examine the Scoria of
your refractory Ore 3 to see whether there may not
be some Graius of the Regulus dispersed in it : For
sometimes the Scoria’s that grow clammy, retain
something of the Metal: Which if you suspeCc,
pound the Scoria into a fine Dust, and thus the
Graius of Metal will appear, if there are any left ;
because they can never be pounded fine.

4. Silver is separated out of the Regulus by copel-
ling (ΝΟ. 3), according to Process 11. But while
you are weighing the Regulus of Silver obtained,
you must put into the opposite Scale, the small Mass
of Silver‚ which has remained in the Coppel‚ out of

{lie tvyellxie Centners of the Lead employed. (See
rores .)

The Use and Reafhns cqf the Proceſsu

1. All Earths and Stones are refractory in the Fire:
For though some of them melt naturally in the Fire,
as those that are vitrificable do ς nevertheless‚ all
the others, a very few exceptcd, melt much more
difficultly than Metals‚ and never become so thin in
the Fufion, as is required for the sufficient Precipi-
tation ofa precious Metal. But Litharge itself does
not conveniently diffolve these rest-aetery Matters by
the I-Ielp ofFire alone, unless you add some mecha·
nical Mixture to them: For the very Moment the
said Litharge penetrates through the Interstices of the
refractory Ore, and begins to cliffolve it, a tenacious
Mass is produced, which hardly admits any further
Dilution by the Litharge. You may see it plain, if
you make coloured Glaffes with metallick Calxs : If
