ASSAYING METALS‘. 123

does not appear neatly enough, lick it over with
Spittle not frothy, and then the Colours will· be more
lively reflected.

304. Befides the Utenfils hitherto described (ξ 168,
301) you must h-ave a convenient Place for the per-
forming of the docimastical Operations. You must
havea Chimney‚ large enough to place the Furnaces,
and capable of quite confining the Fumes ·, which,
tho' not all mortal‚ are neverthelessalways hurfful, in
almost all Operations when they can come out freely.
Eut as these aeid Fumes corrode the Metals them-
selves, it is not proper to keep in the Laboratory
such metallick Utens113‚ as must be preserved very
clean3 for instance the Scale3‚ with their Weights‚
the Touch-Needles, &a which must be kept in a
cleaner Place: nor must you keep there many dif-
serent Menstrua, except they are in Vefl'els perfeffly
closed ε for some of them, by sending forth their Va-,
ponrs, change the others, and are mutually altered
by them ·‚ so that you can no longer make any exact
Experiment with the same. Moreover, as you must
frequently observe very minute Bodies‚ and their se-
veral Changes in and out of the Fire; the Laboratory‚
which in the first Case must be darkened, in this must
be rendered very bright : which may be easlly ob-
tained, by hanging up thick or black Curtains against

the Windows.
