ASSAYING METALS. 229

When you see this, add with a Ladle two Centners
of Glass of Lead into each Test 3 in such Manner,
that it may be spread wide, through the whole Sur-
iace of the rejected Calx, Thus the Calx of the Tin
is so much involved and penetrated by the Glass of
Lead, that at last it changes its Form of a Powder‚
into the tenacious Form of Glass. If you pereeive
this, increase the Fire to its highest Degree ·, stir up
the Scoria’s with a warni Poken and when you have
seen the Sigus of a compleated Scorification„ pour
out the Mass,; and for the Rern, observe here the
same Tffings, which we prescribed in the third Pro-
cess,

3. The Scoria’s being separated, put both Regu-
lus’s into two Coppels well heated ; and put into a.
third Coppel sixteen Centners of Lead, and one Cent-
ner of the same Copper which you have used for the
Scorification (N0 1.) of Tin ·‚ that you may be able
to determine, how much Silver‚ Copper‚ and Lead,
these Qantities contain‚ which must be afterwards
substracted (Proc. ΙΙ. N⁰ 5). For if you neglect to
do this, you cannot be sure of having separated the
Silver from the Tin. Let the Regimen of the Fire
'be the same during the Coppelling, asin the fixth
ProcesS. But the other two first Regulus’s, must
weigh the same in the Balance: If not, the Process
must be repeated.

Another Methocl,

1. Reduce your Tin into ahin Lamina’s or into
Filings·‚ or, ifit is brittle‚ pound it to a fine Pow-
der : Then put two half Centners of it into two sepa-
rate Tests ·‚ put them under the Muffel, and make a
middling Fire‚ that they may turn to Assies: Then
take out the Tests ε Mixt with each Part of the Assies
two Centners of Glass ofLead, and then put each
separate Mixture with twelve Centners of Lead into
the same Tests, and perform the Scorification in the
sanie Manner as in the third ProcesS. But make the.
