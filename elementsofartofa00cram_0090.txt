74 The ART of

227. Finally‚ affaying requires that you should
have two Mortars·, one of Iron and deep, to beat
Bodies small ·‚ the other less deep, of Iron or Wood,
and wide3 this must have a wooden«Pestle. The
latter, most commonly of Iron, serves for Amalga-
mations : For iron-Mortars are most fit for thiswork ;
because, though something of the iron be eroded by
the Trituration, it nevertheless mixes not with the
Amal ,agir-na: So that Iron is to be preferred to all
other Metaris, in Operations of this Kind.Bes1des,
Mercury may be moderately heatcd therein‚ whereby
the Amalgarnation is very much accelerated. Which
cannot be so easily effected ιη a wooden-Mortar.

228. ssefides, for some Operations not directly be-
longing to the Art of Affiying, though it is proper
that the Affayer should be able to make them, by
help of his own Skill, you must have distillatory Ves-
sest, such as earthen and glast-Cucurbites and Re-
torts: But these being sufficiently known, and· de-
scribed every where in chemical Books, Ineed not
here be very particular in describing of thern. I
{hall only observe‚ that the glass-Veffels which are
to sustain a great Fire, are the better as they are
thinner : For, when thick⁷ they soon split. But it is
the contrary for the Recipient‚ which must be
thicker.

229. When the vessels (ᾗ 228.) are exposed naked
to the greatest Pire3 it eafily happenS, that they
burst, by throwing fresh cold Fuel into the Fire ε For
the preventing of which, you must have Recourse to
Lorication or Coating. This is performed in the'
following Manner ; Take some of the fame Mamer,
of which the Muffels and Crucibles are made (ᾗ 188),
and, instead of Water‚ moisten it with fresh Blood,
not yet coagulated‚ and dilnted with twice or thrice
the fiune Qantity of Water, to make a thin Paste
ofit ε Then add to this Paste Cow-hairs, or others
not very long nor stiff: And if you have at Hand
Glass pulverized, and fifted, it may also be ofService,

to mix some of it with the rest. Then with tlgssMass
