trous Barth, and mix them with once and a half a&
much of quick-Lime and alkaline Alhes, or add
instead of these half a Pound of Pon-ash : Put these
Things into a wooden Tub os a sufficient Capaeity 3
pour upon thern about the double Qantity of warm
Wnter‚ and leave then] thus for four and twenty
Hours : lt· is proper to llirr the Whole now and then
with a wooden-Stick. Next, pour the whole Mass
into a linnen-Bag: The Lye will first pass through
turbid ς pour it again into the Bag, to strain it a se-
cond Time 3 which done, it will be transparent and
yellow. This done, let it boil in a large Kettle, till
so much of the Liquor be diffipated, as that a small
Drop of it: let fall upon a cold Surface may congeal¹
Take the Kettle from the Fire, and let the Solu-
tion cool for one Day and one Night : You will see
whether any Crystals (Pas-t Ι. § 21·) are produced,
Dilute the remaining Solution in the double Quantity
of warrn Water: Then inspiffite it, and let it coo] z
Repeat the same as long as Crystals will be produced
by the Solution : There will remain at last a thick fat:

⁶ Liquid, Which may indeed be inspifl‘ated‚ but will

not turn to CrystaIS‚ and eafily runs to VVater again
in the Air.

3. If you are willing to have these Crystals very
pure, diffolve them in eightTimes as much Water;
filtrate them through a Paper3 add to thern a few
Drachms of Qick-lime‚ and make them digest with
it a whole Day. Drop into this Liquor a few small
Drops ofan alkaline Solution. If, a little after, you
see small Clouds in the Solution, go on, till it is no
longer turbid t It is never necessary to drop above
half an Ounce into it. This done, filtrate it through
a Paper3 evaporare it in a short Glass-Cucurbite‚ and
when you see a small Pellicle‚ let it grow cold. The
ssower it cools, the larger and finer the Crystals will
be. You must always dilute the Refidue with the
double Qantity of warm Water, before you expose
it to the Evaporation‚ and repeat the Crystalliza‹
tion, till the Nitre is entirely exhausted. ·
