Preparation (gf Allum.

APPARATU&

1. H E Minerals of Allum‚ as well as those of

Vitriol‚ must be prepared many different
Ways, to get Allum out of them. For there are
some ananan-,orm fat, bituminous Minerals, which
being heaped up in the Air, grow warm, smoak,
crumble, and sometimes take Flame; but, this is not
done without some Loss of the Allum, and it must be
prevented‚ by pouring Water upon and disjoining
the concrete Heap : They finally separate, and as-
sume the sweetish, styptick, nauseous Taste of Alium,
which before was but little or even not perceived at
all in this Mineral. Some barren MineralS‚ as well
as the Pyrites‚ require a gentle previous Roasting,
which being done, the Allum is at last produced.
Chuse out of this Heap a Specirnen of some common
Pounds, put it in a Lead or Glassvefl'el, and pour
upon it three Times as much VVater z Make it boii,
and strain it through a* Filtre·, pour again warin
Water upon it, and make it bo‘il another Time,
that the remaining Earth may be well edulcorated.
Pour the Solutions together, and let them rest for
one Day and( one Night together, that the Dregs
may subfide to the Bottom; or strain it again through
the F iltre :> Then, let the clear Liquor be so in·
spiffated as that it may sustain a new laid Egg put
into it : Let it grow cold again, and rest four and
twenty Hours: At last you will see what will be
precipitated: For, Crystals of Vitriol are sometimes
produced ς and sometimes the Allum is expelled. If
