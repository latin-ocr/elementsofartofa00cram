ASSAYING METALS'. 163

Pot-Afhes, clud then melt it in cz great Fire 3 this‘ pro-
duces a Glass, whofie Colour is almos} black ·, which how-
ever, 2s thrown into Water immediate& aster it is put in
Fufim, and then ground audstftea‘, produces the fiuest
blue Powder, which is called Smalt †.

If the sels-same Zafre, or the Smalt made ofit‚ is mixt
with a hundred ‘limes as much, or more, of crystalline
pounded Glass, or with any other of the Ingredients eut of
which white Glaffes are made3 then the Colour which
appeared st) very hluck in the meltecl Smalt alone, turns
into the most beautiful hlue saphiriue Colour .· whence
some pretend, that the Word Zafre has had its orzgiuczl.

tect whether it is or ever was found native, in the
same Form mentioned (ξ 14), is a Secret to me:
nor is there any known kind of Ore, out of which
this semi-Metal may be melted, in the same Manner
as the other Metals and serni-Metals are melted out
of theirs. ’

, 409. Therefore‚' all the Zink that is prepared in

Germany, especially at Gestar, is obtained by Subli-
mation‚ not by Eliquation‚ and not got out of any
singular Ore, but out of such an intricate and con-
fused Mixture of different Ores, that several other
Metals and semi-Metals may be separated at the same
Time from it. Iron, Lead‚ and Copper are also
contained in it in great Plenty: and are almost all
involved in Sulphur and Arsenick.

410. There are no peculias Sublimations made for
the extraeting of Zink, but, by a Sort of secondary
Operation, it is colleCstd during the Eliquation of
the other Metam especially of Lead.

v 411. lt is proper here to explain the Manner, in
which the Sukzlimation of Zink (ᾗ 409.) is made, be·-
