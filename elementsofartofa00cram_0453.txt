AssavtNG METALS. 427

not metallick, which not only give Glaffes the deep-
est Colours3 but also reduce the destroyed Colours
which had been first produced by Metals. Such are
the Capita Momm of Cobalt and Bismuth‚ several
Bodies merely terrestri-al, inflammable‚ fuligffious,
&a ’ From these Matters of Fa& it is plain, that
these Vitrifications ought to be performed with the
utmost Care and Cirrumspeffion, and much more
nearly than all the other chemical Operations 3 fince
they may be disturbed by so many very small and
hardly perceptible Causes. »

2. I shall, in favour of those who love to make
Experiments about Vitrifications, here ihew in a few
Words, how they can be performed conveniently
with the least Apparatus and Expence : For which
Purpose, I shall, to the best of rny power, here col-
lect and mention what Authors have told us on this
Matter‚ and what Irnyself arn sure of from my own
Experience. The Authors who have given us the
Things chiefly appertaining to our present Purpose‚
are Antonius Neri, an Italian Priest‚ on whose Works
Dr. Merret has given us a Commentary‚ and tran-
ssated them from the Italian into English, and then
into Latin. Kunkel has added Notes to both, more
valuable than the two foregoing, as he has confirmed
what was true, mended the Errors, and, what is
much more, unfolded immense Difficulties by them
left unravelled, the whole written in the German
Language *ἢ

The Furnace that is necessary sor these Experi-
ments, is represented in Tah. VI. Fzg.1‚ ΙΙ, and ΙΙΙ,
and described at the End of this second Part. I have
at last, by much Experience‚ so adapted this F urnace
to these OperationS, that a much more violent F ire
may be applied to the Vesstls, and many of them be
put at once into it, and the Roastings and Calcina-
tionS, here requifite very long, may be performed in

* But will soon be publifhed in Englzyh‚ being already transsated
by the ingenious Dr. Hampe.
