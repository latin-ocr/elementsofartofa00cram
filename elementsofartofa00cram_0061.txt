AssAYtNG METALS. 47

tals, Therefore‚ the Dross of Silver is very easy
that of Tin, Copper‚ and Iron more difficult, ans
that of Lead the most difficult of all, to be melted

148. If you throw into a Crucible, red hot on the·
Fire, white artificial Arsc’nz‘ck, mixed with one tenth
Part of Brimstone, and cover it immediately with a
Tile3 and then pour it out after it has been one or
two ⁹Minutes 1n Fusion‚ it becomes a solid brittle Boo·
dy, of a Citron Colour ; but if you melt it in the
same Manner with a fifth Put of Rrirnffone, the
MasS‚ when grown cold, affumes the red Colour3 if
at last you melt or sublimate Arst‘nick and Sulphur
together, in an equal Qantity‚ it produces a fine red
transparent Mass, which is called Rubinus Arsenicczlis‚
Sulphur Auratum, the Arsenical Ruby,Su1phur of
Gold.

149. Brimstone, melted with half the Qantity of
fixed Alcalz' (ξ 96), turns into Hepar Susphuris, Liver
of Sulphur, so called from its being of a Livet· Co-
lour ; which, on account of the alcaline Sall it con-
tains, makes all Earths and Βίωνες melt soon in the
Fire. When melted with any Metal whatever, it
presently makes it run, and renders it brittle, no
longer like a Metal or Semi-Metal, and makes it dis-
solvable by Water: This is so general, that even
Gold and Silver are not excepted. Therefore, there
are many Cautions to be used in the roasting of-Oczrs
by different Fufions.

150. A like Hepar (ξ 149.) will be produced with
vitriolate Tartar with Glass-Gczll and other neutral
fixed Salts‚ containing the vitriolick Acid, if, when
they are red οι· in Fufion in the Fine, you add to them
Con-ciust, or any other more fixt Phlogist.

151. The Hepar Sulphuris ² is not so strong,
when made with fixed Nitre made with Coals, or
with Alcalz' composed of Tartar and Aure, nor with
neutral Salis with an addition of Sulphur, alre Ρᾱόγ con-
taining the vitriolick Acid.
