small Windows with small Shutters to them·‚ that
you may at Pleasure admit or keep off the Air from
it. Against the right, left, and hinder-Walls ofthis
Hut within, contrive square Partitions too Foot
long, as much broad, and one Foot deep, divided
with wooden-Boards one Inch and a half thick. Fill
them with many different Compositions of the Things
mentioned (ξ 438). By this Means, you will be able
to make several Experiments upon this Matter. If
you make a Paste with Mortar *, Ashes, or moist
Earth, pouring Urine upon it, and fill one of your
Partitions therewith ς if besides, you water it a se-
cond Time with Urine, when dry, and beat it well
with a Stick, after every such watering3 you will

dered in these filthy Matters: For, unless a very se-
vere cold Season happens, a Pound of such a Mass
will, in a Month or two, contain about two Ounces
of Nitre. Now the Method of finding out whether
there is any Nitre in a Matrix, and what Qantity
of it lies hidden therein, shall be Ihewn in the second
Volume of this Work, when we come to the Opera-
tions †.

hitherto (ξ 305—440.) described, there are some,
whose Nature and Principles are not yet sufficiently
known ·‚ so that they cannot have any certain and de-
termined Class affigned them. Nevertheless, it is
beyond all doubt, that they no way belong to the
Classes of such as yield precious MetaIS. For Me-
tallurgists and Affayers, in all the Trials they make
about Minerals unknown to them, have almost no
other View, but that of finding out, whether Gold,
Silver, Copper‚ &a may be extra&ed out of them

in those Countries.
