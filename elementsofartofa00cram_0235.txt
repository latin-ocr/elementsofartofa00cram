pleatly made. Nay, there are a great many OreS‚
containing Sulphur and Arsenick in plenty, that de-
stroy a considerable Qantity of Lead : Such are the
red suver-Ore, and that wherein there is a great Deal
of the steel—grained lead-Ore.

3. When you intend to make a perfect Process,
it is not proper to make one and the same Test serve
for many Proceffes, but you must always chuse a new
one ε For in all Proceffes‚ you must take Care that
no foreign Body may accrue to that in hand, or that
nothing may be lost of the WVeight already deter-
mined ε Which will eafily happen, if you use old,
uncle-an Veffels and Instruments.

4. There are some, who wrap up their Ore in a
Paper, or put it into a small Ladle, and hold it
thus upon hot boiling Lead: But we rejest this Me-
thod, because the Volatiles‚ especially the Arsenick,
being agitated by so sudden and violent a Heat‚ may
carry off along with them a great Deal of the Silver:
There are likewise many Ores, but chiefly the red
filver-Ooe, which being exposed to a sudden, violent
Heat, burst asunder and disperse ·, or if they don't
do so, at least you will never be certain, whether
there are not Particles of Flint, Spaad, Allum, and
other Stones interposed‚ which crackling, may ealily·
fling some Part of the Ore out of the Veffelalong with
themselves. To prevent this, it is enough to cover
the Ore with granulated Lead: For then the Ore
grows -warm by degrees, and as its Particles, when
bursting out, must go through the melted Lead that
covers thern, they are so much involved by its Calx
grown clammy, that they cannot leap out.

5. If the Fire must sometimes be diminished in the
Middle of the Process, it is in order to hinder the
too much attenuated Litharge, which is continually
generated out of the Lead, from penetrating the Potes
of the Test, and from corroding it : Which is eafily
done, when the Fire is over—strong: For then the
Surface of the Veffiss, which is contiguous to the
Lead, contraits Cavities, or being totally consumed
