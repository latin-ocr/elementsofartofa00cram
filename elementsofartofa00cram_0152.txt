accidentally residing in it. But this Body again, has
this Property ofitself‚ or at least is such relatively
to this or that Ore to Which it is adherent.

335. As we are here upon Ores in general, we
shall only touch upon those Tffings, which, by their
Presence, render almost all Ores refraetory, or alto-
gether unfufible. But we shall mention in our praffi-
cal Part, when we treat of Ores in a more special
Mamer, the Things which produce this Effect, only
with regard to some particular kind of Ore. All Ores
lie hidden in Earths‚ Stones, or in other Ores, asin
Matrices z if then these Matrices of themselves melt
iu the Fire with very great difficulty, or not at all ;
the Ore contained in them, may indeed of its own
Nature be put in ftifion3 but yet it cannot be thus
delivered of its Matrix, because this is not fufible.
Such are for Instance hon-Ores, which by their Na-
ture are always difficultly mested, and on thisAccount
render other Mines difficult to be put in Fusion, when
they are naturally intermixed with them. It is the
same with almost all the Smnes and Earths‚ a few only
excepted, which are ranked among the vitrificable
ones: nor are these all of them very easy to be
melted : for though they are put in Fusion by Fire ·‚
they most commonly become at the same Time so
clammy‚ that they hinder the precipitation and Ex-
cuffion of the small metallick Mafl'es. The Lime-
Stones (§ 30), and those that are not affec'ted by Fire
(ᾗ 31), render the Ores intermixt with them most
stubborn of any3 so that they cannot be perfec‘tly
melted with Fire alone„ even the most violent. Of
these two the latter are still worse than the former.
'What we have hitherto said, is equally understood
of all Ores, whatsoever they may be.

337. Some of the Stones just mentioned (ᾗ 336.)
are much lighter than the Ores intermixt with them z
so that these may be easily removed, either by only
pounding, washing, and extinguissiing thern in Wa-
ter, or by a previous Calcination‚ leaving the
weightier Particles of the Ore at the Bottom of the
