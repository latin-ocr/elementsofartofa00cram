Times, by making it very recl-hot over and over
again ·, that the remaining terrestrial‚ scorified parm,
may be expelled out of its Interstice3‚ and the metal-
lick Partieles be united together. This is called in
German §Dutt‘ljzstbmeiffeuz And when the Operat-
tion is well performed, it communientes to Iron,
whether red-hot or colel, its due Malleability. It is
observable here, that any Iron, though ever so pure,
is perfeffly mallea‘ole, when melted in a reducing
¹Fire ; bnt yields with Difficulty to the Hammer im-
mediately after the Fufion. It likewise becomes ri-
giel, ifsnddenly cooled, especially if it‘is immersed
in Water: However‚ this Rigidity happens only in
cold Weathen and is not so great as that of melted
crude Iron, and may be perfeetly reduced to its first
State, if after having been red-hot for a few Hours
in a pure gentle Fire, it cools ofitself very ssowly.
Nay, other hard Nletals, such as Copper, Brass,
Silver, and Gold, harden after the Frffion, or after
having been beaten over and over with the Ham-
mer, but never to such a Degree as Iron, and their
Flexibleness is restored by the same Artifice, that is,
by being made red-hot, and cooled by very ssow
Degrees 3 so that they afterwards grow almost as
pliant as Lead. But you must take Care that there
‚js no smoaking Flame proceeding chiefly from the
cruder CharcoalS, otherwise the Softening does not
'succeed. This may be observed chiefly in Gold,
.which‚ though very pli-ant and tenaciot1S, yet be-
comes more rigid than Copper, when an extinguished
Charcoal, still smoaking‚ and half burnt, falls into
it, while it is perfeffitly red-hot, or melted in a Cru-
cible.

As for the rest, you must observe here, that there
is no Metal, that suffers so great a Diminution of its
Substance in the Excoction, or only in a simple Fu-
fion‚ as Iron does: Nay, if only made very bright
red-hot, it burns away most speedily, or wears out
into scorified Scales. But this Com'oustion happens
