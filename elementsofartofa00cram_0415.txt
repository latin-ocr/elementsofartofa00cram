remaining Salt. Diffolve the other Portion of this Li-
ver of Sulphur in a glass Veffel, with treble the
Qantjty 0f pure Water : There will remain a brown
sediment‚ which will be Sulphur not quite diss'olved
by the Alkali: Pour upon this Solution the strongest
Spirit of Vinegar drop by drop, a white Powder will
be precipitated, which is called Lac Sulphuris, or
Mill< of Sulphur ε Stir up this Liquor, and pour it
*quite tui-bid into a filtrating Paper, when it ¹‘is all
gone through, pour again upon it Spirit of Vinegarl
drop by drop, that in Case more of the Lac Sulphuris
is again expelled, it may be joined to the foregoing,
by repeating the Filtration: What gathers in the
filtrating Paper being dry, if you distil it out of the
Retort, it will afford Sulphur (Proc. LXVII.)
Thence it appear3‚ how much Sulphur was hidden
in the first Portion before the Roasting. But as the
Acid of the Sulphur remained alone in the first Por-
tion, after the inflammable Part was diffipated‚ it is
certain that the Excess of the Weight of the ex-
tracted Salt, by which this surpaffes the Half of the
Weight of the Alkaline Saltemployed, proceeds from
thence, and this Excess of Weight shews of Course,
how much Acid there is in the Sulphur which you
have got by Precipitation and Sublimation. Thus
you find that the Acid is about fifteen Times more
weighty than the Phlogiston‚ as has been demon·
strated by Dr. Stahl. But, as during the Fufion of
the Liver of Sulphur, not only Part of the pure Sul-
phur is diffipated, but there is also an unpleasant
Smell perceived, which is different from the Odour
of Sulphur, such as is emitted in the subsequent Roast-
ing of the Liver of Sulphur·‚ we are hereby informed,
that Part of the Phlogiston having left its Acid, is at
that Time diffipated, and that on this Account more
Acid is attributed to the remaining Sulphur expelled
withVinegar and purified by Sublimation, than it has
in reality. Therefore, it is proper, that you 1hould
use pot-Ash made perfeffly pure, and try the Caput
Mortuum remaining after the Sublimation of the Lac
