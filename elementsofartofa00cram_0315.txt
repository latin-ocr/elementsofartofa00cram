Lute: Another Sign of Success is, when no Parti-
cles of Lead appear separate in the whole Veffel, but
when they all gather into a solid, tenaciouS‚ duffii,
bluish, not very bright Regulum and when the Sco-
ria's are hard, black and solid, except when there are
a few small Cavities in the Middle‚ when they are
contiguous with the common Salt ε For the Salt does
not mix with the Flux; but remains separate, and
swims a Top, being however of a black Die. When
the Scoria is soft, light, pulverulent, taking not
much less Room than the other Things put into the
Crucible, this shews that the F ire having been defec-
tive both in Strength and Duration, the Lead has not
on this Account been sufficiently precipitatecl out of
the Scoriae ; the same will be ffiewn by a rough Re-
gulus, having high Protuberances‚ as also a blackiffl
Brightness like that of the lead-Ore, and finally by
Grains of Lead inherent among the Scoria’s especially
towards the Bottom, in which Case the Operation
must be repeated. The last Case sometimes happens,
when a red hot Crucible is suddenly extinguished in
Water‚ or put up in a moist Place. You know
from the outward silvery Colour of the Regulus,

that the Fire is too great or has lasted too long ·,

you know it also, when the Scoria’s and the Bottom

of the Veffel appear covered with a Sort of white

and neat Scale, while they are contiguous with the

Regulus. The Operation has succeeded worse still,

when the Regulus appears full of Cavities, when

these Cavities seem to {hine at the Infide, with an

Intermixture of the Colours of the Rainbow‚ and
