round it with Coals : Mean while, invert the melt-
ing Cone or the Mortar, and throw out ofit the Mass
already grown solid. The inferior Part of it will
bea Regulus, which confists of some Part of the Sil-
ver, and of the whole Qantity of the Gold that was
in the Mixture. The Upper-Part will be a Mixture
of the Remainder of the Silver, and of part of the
precipitating F lux : Take off the Regulus and
keep it: P‘ut the sulphureous Mixture broken and
still warm, into the same Crucible3 make it mest,
and put upon it the same Qantity of the precipitat-
ing Flux, just as you did the first Time, that the
Regulus may be again precipitated ε Pour it anew
into the Cone or Mortar ·, and after having separated
the upper Mixture from the Regulus, precipitate it a
third Time, and by the same Qantity of Nux, in
the same Crucible : Nay, if you find by the Experi-
ment (ΝΟ. 1,) that there is a great Deal of Gold in the
Grmmla3 it will be proper to do the same for the
fourth Time-

stirred up with a bisch-Broom, that it may be granu-
lated z Then pour the second Regulus into the same
Crucffile, taking, mean whste, the granulated Metal
out of the Veffel : This done, granulate in the same
Manner the second or third Regulus, and also at last
the first ·, that you may have each Regulus grarlulated
feparately. Take of the dried Granulation of each
Regulus, one docimastical Mark of the smallest
Weight, Proc. XXIV. ΝΟ. ι, and try each of them
separately in a small Coppel‚ to know whether any
Part of the precipitating Metals has not perhaps
been mixt with them, and how much. Then make
the small Portions of Gold and Silver remaining in
{vhe Coppel, go through a strffier Tria} by Aqua
orm.

You will find the Gold of the whole Mixture found
out by Experiment, N0. 1, either totally, or at least
in the greatest Part concentrated in the first Regulus .·
