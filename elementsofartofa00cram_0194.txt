say, that this fossss Salt is found native about the
Vulcano’s‚ or Mountains that vomit Fire, as also in
the sandy‚ dry, burning Places that are about and un-
der the torrid Zone·‚ and that it is likewise evapo-
ratecl from the Crevices of the Rocks in Persia. But
the vulgar Salt Ammoniac which is sold, is all arti-
ficial, and is produced out of the Bodies, which ac-
tually, and in reality coutain common Salt‚ or its
Acid, and the volatile alkaline Salt. Because these
are two principles, of which every Kind of Salt Arn-
moniac confists, and into which it may be resolved
by Art ·, therefore the Urine of Animals, especi-
ally of those that use common Salt 3 the Suet of many
inflammable Bodies, &a yield salt. They say,
that the Salt which is brought us from Egypt, which
is the most common, is prepared by Sublimation‚ ei-
ther out of the Soot osburnt Dung * of Animals
alone, or out of this very Soot mixt again with com-

That which is brought from the East-Indoen not in
flat convex Loaves, but in conical Oues, like sugar-
Loaves, is rare, and the Manner in which it is made,
unknown. It is enough for us to be certain, that
every true Salt Ammoniac may be resolved into the
two Principia before-mentioned, and that likewise
out of these, Salt may he made in every Respe& per-
fectly like native or artificial Salt.
