made with coal-Dust : Put into this Bed the Coals
and the Iron to be melted‚ heaped up in good Qian-
tity in Strata, then with the Bellows blow the Fire

pretty strongly, that thev Iron may be brought to a.
Fufion : And if it does not melt soon of itself, and

emit Abnndance of Scoria's> it is necessary to help
on the Fusion with fulible Scoria's, or with Sand,
Let the Fire not be much greater than is necessary
to make all these Matters melt as equally as poffible :
Let the melted Mass be agitated here and there, that
all the Parts ofit may feel the Aetion of the Fire and
Air equally: And let the increafing Scoria's be taken
out at one or two Times, ln the mean Time, a
great many Sparkles, like Ram, will be thrown out
from the Iron, which diminish the more, as the Iron
comes nearer to the defired Degree of Purity‚ but
they never cease intirely. Then let the burning
Coals be removed, and the Scoria's be conveyed out
of the Fire, through a Channel made for that Pur-
pose ·, but, when the Iron grows solid, let it be taken
red-hot out of the Fire, and tried by striking it with
a Hammer : Ifit proves crude still, let the Melting
be repeated: And when at last sufficiently purified,
let it be hammmed, and extended several WayS, by
making it red-hot many Times over : This done it:
will no longer be brittle‚ even when cold.

The Uft and Reasons of lhe Process. Β

The remaining volatile Materials which make Iron
brittle, and keep it in a mineral State, are diffip'ated
in this Operation by the Fire and Air ; the terres-
trial, unmetallick, vitrified Parts, are rejefted under
the Form of Scoria's, while the Iron is in a perse&
State of Fufion: Nor can this, however, be done
with sufficient Exac‘tness by a single Fufion: Nay,

Iron does not even acquire its defired Degree of ·

Malleability by a second Fufion alone, but when cold‚
and strongly hammered‚ it fiies asunder‚ or at least
cracks; for which Reason it must be hammeredssgg?
