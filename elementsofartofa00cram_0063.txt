same Fire which is proper to be used in Cementations‚
that is, not a very strong one ·, on this Account, they
use aQantity of Brick-dust, Colcothar, &o three or
four times greater3 lest the Salts happening to melt,
by employing a Fire a little stronger, they should at
the sameTime put the Metals in Fufion‚ and above all
Gold and Silver : For this is the Method of prevent-
ing the melting of Salts ς or if they melt‚ you at least
hinder them by that Means from running together,
and from hardening to such a Degoee, as that the
Mass may not be pulled asunder, and the interposed
Metal be separated, but with difficulty. For the
same Reason, it is not proper here to use Bole alone,
as an additional Help, because it hardens like a δίωκε
in the F ire.

155· But, that the Spirits which are driven out
(ὃ 153, 154.) of the Matter of the Cenzent, may a&
the longer and with greater Force3 the vessels in
which the Cementation is made, must be closed, the
Closures being stopped with Clay‚ though not alto-
gether without vent. By this Means the Spirits are
beaten back, and yet not so absolutely confined, as
not to be able, when the Fire is increased‚ to make
their way through the Closures of the Veffels; which
vent being not given thern, the Veffels would infalli-
bly burst.

156. Among MetaIS‚ Copper‚ Iron, Lead, irin,
and all Semi—Metals, being committed to any os the
above—mentioned (ξ 153, 154.) Cements, are totally
corroded in a few Hours : Which will be the sooner
done, if they are intermixed with the Cement, in form Α
of Lamina’s, or ofGranulation.

157. Thus it is that Silver is immediately con-
sumed by the several Species ossz'rit of Nitre .· Nay,
spirit of Salt consumes Silver, when used in this Man-
ner, which otherwise does not corrode it, when it has
the Form ofa fiuid Body. Nor does Silver refist the
Vapours of Vim-iol in a Cementution. Nay, the Vine-
,ξαν of Vegetables isself, concentrated in the Crystals
of Μητῐζςψεψ, and mixed with terrestrial Bodies,
