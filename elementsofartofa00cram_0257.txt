Every Body may easily reduce this Ta'ble to the
Needles made according to the Mark of the Avoir-
depoids, or that of Karats: Nor is it necessary to
proportion the Qantities of Lead t=o be added, so
far as one half-Centner.

2. In the mean Time, let the Meta} to be tried
with the NeedleS‚ undergo the Operation of Cop-
pelling, together with the Qantity of Lead indi-
cated ⁷(N0 1), as in the fixth Process. Only you
are to observe concerning the Regimen of the F ire,
that you must make it the gentler, as the Silver is
allayed with a greater Qantity of Copper 3 and on
the contrary, the smaller the Qantity of the Ailay
of Copper is, the stronger must be the Fire to be
used in the Operation. As for the Rest, all we
have1 ‘said in the fixth Process doth likewise belong
to t ls.
