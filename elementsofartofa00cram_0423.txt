sor having managed it without Caution. Thereflore,
let all Proceffes with Arsenick be made under a
Chimney that carries Smoak well : For the Vapour
of Arsenick is not so quickly condensed, but sorne-
thing of it escapes through the Joints of the Veffess,
and fills the Air with a Poison, which betrays itself‚
by its unpleasant garlick-like Sinell. It is still more
dangerous, when to be reduced toafine Powder : For
notwithstanding its great specifick Weight, when
the Powder is violently agitated3 it is easily carried
away by the Air, not affecting the Smell nor the
Taste‚ but yet perniciou3‚ if drawn into the Lungs
together with the Breath. -

APPARATUS.

1. E T the Arsenick be reduced to a most subtile

L Powder by a ssow Trituram'gsn: Which is
very conveniently performed in a stone-Mortar. This
done, pour upon it a few Drops of Mercury : Con-
tinue the Trituration, the Mercury will insenfibly

disappear, and the fine yellow or red Colour of the
Arsenick will be darkened: This done, add some

more Mercury without ceasmg the Trituration 3 till
at last the Powder receives no more Mercury, and
there remains not the least Appearance of the yellow
or the red Colour in the Mixture, but it affut-nes either
a grey Colour‚ if there was but very little Sulphur
in the Arsenick‚ or a black Dye, if it contained a
good Deal: Which can hardly be done in some
Hours, if you employ a Pound of Arsenick. But in

this very Case, it is proper to perform the Tritura-
tion in separate ParceIS.
