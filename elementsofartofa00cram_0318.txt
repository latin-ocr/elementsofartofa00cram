this Reason, a Fire that has a Draught os Air procu-
red without Bellows‚ is preferable for the performing
of this Process, to a Fire made with Bellows‚ because
the Fire may be governed more accurately in the
former than in the latter Case. It is better to leave
the Veffels a little too long in the. Pire, than to take
them out too soon ς for when the Fire is too ssaek,
there is more of the Lead detained in the Scoria’s
than there can be consumed of it, by a proportion-
able Excess of the Fire·, Therefore‚ unless you per-
ceive Signs of a very great Exces3‚ there is no need
of repeating the Operati0n3 whereas the repeating
of it is unavoidable‚. if you find that the Pire has
been wanting.

PROCESS XXXI.

To reduce and precipitata Lead from an Ore rendered
refrafflory by Pyrites.

APPARATUS.

1. O AST two (Senta-ers of the Ore, (accord-

Β ing to Proc. XXX. No. 1.) with only this
Differenoe, that you rnust make a Fire a little strong-
er from the Beginning to the End. The Pyrites‚ es-
pecially that which is merely of Iron, hinders an
Ore easily growing clammy, from turning into large
Lumps, or intirely from melting. Beat the Ore
roasted and grown cold to a subtile Powder, and
repeat the Roasting a second, and even a third Time ;
till growing at last a little red hot in the Fire, there
does remain no Smell of Sulphur at all.

2. Mix the roasted Ore with lix Centners of black
Flux, and with two of Glass-gall. Do the rest as
in the foregoing Process; except th”at the F ire must
be a little greater and longer continued in the End
than if you had a susible Ore to smelt.
