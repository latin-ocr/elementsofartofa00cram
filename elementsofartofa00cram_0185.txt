Bismuth-Ores are rather found in manyofthose Places,
which Authors say contain Zink in plenty, than
Zink-Ores: for Instance, in England, the Zink of

make their Cement or §older .· for from them we have it, and thas at
very clear Rates. The Ore cf it I have not seen, nor as yet could pro-
cure ; am! Ifhoulal be very glad to hear that any of it could be obtained,
ον any of itfoun'd in England.
