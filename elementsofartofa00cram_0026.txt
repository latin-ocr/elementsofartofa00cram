30. Limcstones constitute another kind, which when
burnt in the greatest Fire, are so changed as either.to
soften in the F ire immediately, or to cleave into Lime
by adding ’Ναὶ-ει* to them. Of this Class are,

N⁰ 1'. Spathum‚ or Spaad‚ which isa softStone‚ and
‘will be render'd so very brittle by the mildest Fire,
in which it makes a gentle Crackling, that you may
reduce it into Dust between your Fingers. It varies
its Gravity, as it is more or less compact. It most com-
monly confists of rhomboidnl, often of prismatical‚ pa-
rallel, and oblong Parts, varioussytransparent, and
generally of a watery or milky Colour.

N02. Affarbffl, which are of a great many Co-
lonrs, and often of various Colours at‘once. Marble
is a hard Stone, most commonly opaque: If, after ha-
ving been burnt in a great Fire, it is exposed in the
Air, or wet with &Vitrea it generally cleaves with
greatViolence into a thin limy Powder: But this still
has an Exceptiom for there are Marbles extremely
neat :and fine, which, in a Fire not over-violent, turn
into an opane kind ol' Glass, but not at all into
Lime. ,

N⁰ 3. Stalai-*sisae or Drep-Stones, which is a light soft
Stone commonly οἴη white or grey Colour, therefore
always calcareous, and will always burn into Lime.
It seldom proves ofanother Nature.

31. Finally, there are Stones which in the greatest ·

common Fire‚ either do not change at all⁹ or at least
are never melted‚ nor reduced into Lime by being
wet: Whencethey are very properly called Apyri, οι·
such whereon the Fire hath no Effect.

N⁰ 1. Challe deserves the first Rank among these,
as it suffers no Alteration‚ if pure, not even in the
the Focus ofa Burning-glass. It is light, white, sofr,
and porous. It transmits 'Water through it, and fer-
ments with all Acids, in which it also diffolves. It is
not fat, but rough to theTouch.

ΝΟΖ. The chalky and impure-Marlescome next: To
their Class must be referred the Terra Tripolitana, or
Trlpoly, which is like Chassz, but lighter‚ and feels sof-

ter.
