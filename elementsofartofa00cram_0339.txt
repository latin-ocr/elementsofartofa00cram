Circumstance. All these Things pass through the
F urnace whence proceeds a Regulus, in which sold,
Silver, Copper, and Lead are concentrated‚ but in
a rough Manner (N ‘’.1 )= However, the Lead which
chiefly receives the Gold and Silver, is sometimes
colle6ted into a Regulus by itself, and gets to the
lower Part of the Bed, with an Abundance of
Scor-5:2³5.

4. The Precipitation of the Ore out of the scori-
ficated Stones‚ must be chiefly attributed to the Py·
rites in the ProcesS. For the Martial Earth which is
in the Pyrites‚ leaves its Sulphur in the very Begin-
ming, when the Fire begins to ach and this Sul-
phur being agitated by so great a F ire, carries away
a great many metallici< Par-ticles, especially of Iron
(Proc. XXXIX. us? ΝΟ. ῐ.); Therefore‚ both these,
which are found every where, the StoneS‚ that conceal
Ores and are intermixt with them, being broken small,
diffolve and penetrate them, and dispose them to a
Scorification3 which happens the more constantly‚
because Sulphur is so strongly lixed by iron Particles
adherent to it, that it cannot evaperate very quickly,
though it is exposed to ever so violent a Fire. The
other Part of the Martial Earth turns to a Scoria.
which, by adding Scoi·i.1’s that contain Lem, and
other fufible Martem, diffolves the Stonesintirely⁹
and bring them to a Fusion. Then the Ores get free
the1efrom, and are precipitated3 and their remaining
Part of martial Earth being reduced to a metallick
State, abiorbs a little of the Sulphur and Arsenick:
On this Account the Metals are concentrated into a
solid weighty Regulus, to which a great Qantity of
the reduced Iron mixeS. Theresore you are to make
the following Observations concerning this Process,
(ι.) That Sulphur is necessarily required, and that
the above-mentioned Operations are performed by the
Concurrence of it, is very plain, because the Pyri-
res destitute of Sulphur is not capable of affisting the
Scorification‚ but ,is rather an Obstacle to it, by its

· refra&ory Qality. (2.) That Iron is not only of a
v scorifying
