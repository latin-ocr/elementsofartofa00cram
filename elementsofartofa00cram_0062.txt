152. We have already declared (§ 104, and 129.)
what were the Effec'ts upon Metals and Senii-Metals
of aeid Afenstrzta, condensed in a fluid F orrn, by a
Heat not greater than that of the F ire which makes
thern ebulliate. It now remainS‚ that we should exa-
mine what are the Effeets of the sels-same Menstrua,
urged with the Degree of Fire which makes them
red hot, ‘upon the Bodies aforesaid.

153· But, as the aeid Salts condensed into Liquors
(ᾗ 105, 108, 113, 126, 128.) cannot bear to be
made red hot, and are resolved by a much less F ire,
into Vapours which cannot be restrained·‚ this re-
quires another manual Operation : For the Acid of
Vinegar cannot be extracted out of the Crystals of
Ver-digreast’, nor the Spirits of Nitre and Salts be ex-
trat‘ted out of thern, by terrestrial Additions, or by
Vim-iol (§ 113, 126) ·, nor in short the Acid of Vitriol
itself be fetched out of its metallick or terrestrial Ma-
trix, without the Action of a very strong Fire.
Therefore‚ you are to proceed in such a Manner, that
the Bodies to be changed by these aeid Spirits‚ bein
the same Veffel wherein the said Spirits are pro-
duced, and, when made red hot therein‚ be surround-
ed on every Side with the agitated Vapours of the
same Spirits. This is easily obtained, if you put the
said Bodies among the Matter itself which is to emit
the acid Spirits‚ after having moistened it lighdy,
and pressed it·, and then expose them together to the
Fire. This Operation is then called Cementation3 and
the dry Species, which melt the aeid Menstrua, and
are commonly used for this Operation, are called
Cernents.

154. The Proportion of the Additions used in
making the Cements, is the sarne as in the Distillation
of aeid Spirits (ᾗ 113, and 126). But common Sall
and Nilre being the melting Eseftstrzta of Metals
(ᾗ 137) ·, and Vim-iol becorning extremely hard, by the
