'two Foot long, ,and one Line and a halfthick (Plat.
IV. Fig. VI). It is proper to have two or three of
‘ these Heoks, that is, as many as there are Vessels to-
gether under the Muffel‚ with the Matter to be stirred,
that you may not be obliged to use the same Hook to
stir them all, and that the Matter in one Veffel may
not be spoiled by Particles of that of another, which
may happen to stick to the Hook ε For you have
not always Time enough topbeat off with a Hammer,
or to file off the adhering Particles.

250. When Ashes must be removed from the Con-'
vexity of the Muffel ; or when Vacuities and Inter-
stices happen to be between the burning Coals, that
render the F ire unequal ⁶, you sometimes introduce
into the Hole of the Affay·0ven (Plat.111. Fzg. Ι. p)
an iron-Rod (Fig.VII), wherewith you throw the Ashes
down, and make the burning Coals fall together.

251. The Matter in the Crucible is to be stirred
with the iton—Hook (Fig. VIII.)

252. When Operations are to be made in the
larger kind of Tests, it is proper to have a stirring
Iron (Fzg. IX.) four Foot long, with which you ei-
ther stir the Mass, or take out the more clammy¹
Scoria’s.

253. When the Grates are stopped, you clear them
with the Hook (Fig. X.) the Size of which is self-
evident.

254. The small iron-Ladle (Fig. XI.) fix Lines in
diameter, well polissied‚ and having a Handle two
Foot long, serves to put Bodies, which must be pre-
viously broken small, into the Vesse13‚ especially such
Veffels as are under the Muffel. You must have a.
larger hollow Ladle‚ whose F igure is sufficiently
known, to melt Lead, Tin, ὃς. in a gentle Fire.

255. A strong Fire, if you look at it too long,
not only dims your Eyes, but also hinders you from
observing distinffly the several Changes of the Bodies.
To remove this Inconveniency, you must provide a.
small Board, made of the driest Wood, and one Foot

both in Length and BreadtlhI 3 that it may screen ζῖοιίι·
