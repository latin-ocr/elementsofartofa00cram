PROCESS LXVIII.

The rein-&ing and suFblliming crude Sulphur into
owers.

APPARATUS.

PUT your Sulphur again into a Retort, having a
wide-open Neck cut off ffiorter3 that it may not
be eafily stopt‚ nor the Extremity of it reach the Wa-
ter in the Recipient : Let the joints be strie'cly closed
with Lute, and, with the same Apparatus as in the
foregoing Process, repeat the Distillation, which
may also be very well made in a Sand-bath. But,
you must use a Fire much gentler than in Proc.
LXVII 3 nor must the Veffel be red-hot in the End ;
but you must continue the same Degree of Fue,
by which the upper-Part of the Recipient which is
void of Water is darkened‚ and the Sulphur begins
to distil from the Neck of the Retort ς because Sul-
phur once expelled out of its Matrix by a strong
Fire, when alone, cannot bear the heating red-hot of
the Veffel z The Sulphur will distil pure 3 because it
has depofited at the Bottom of the Retort, what it
had brought along with it the first Time, from the
fixt Part of the Ore which is metallick‚ and from
the Arsenick (unless it is urged by too violent a
Fire) because aRefidue more fixt than Sulphur re-
mains, which fixes itself more strongly with fixt
Bodies. This ReIidue is called Scoria. of Sulphur,
in German htbmeffelbttblatke, or Dross of Sul-
hur.
p 2. If you will have very pure Flowers of Sulphur,
’ put Sulphur into a wide Cucurbite, or an iron-Pot ·‚
put upon this an Alimbeck, or another Veffel in-
·verted and very large, and stop the Joints with
Lute: Then, bury the inferior Veffel that contains
the Sulphur so deep in a Sand-bath, that the Sand
maybe about as high as the melted Sulphur; or
