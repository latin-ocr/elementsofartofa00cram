APPARATUS.

1. E FO R E you corne to the Process itself‚ yon

B must previoussy know the Allay of your
Gold: which you may try either with the Touch-
stone, or with Aqua Fortis (Proc. XXII): For it is
not necessary to try it by an exact Qartation. But
the Diverfity of the Allay of Gold, demands α cer-
tain Variety in the Way of proceeding. 1f then the
Qantity of the Gold in the Mixture‚ is not less ’
than three Qarters, that is, eightcen Caram, the
Mass must be melted in a wind Fornace, and in the
mean Time the Crucible be covered, to prevent Coals
falling into it. This done, put into it at several
Times the double Qantity of crude Antimony pul-
verized 3 in such Manner, that so soon as one of the
Portions put into it is mested, another bc immediately
supplied : Leave these Things melted in the Fire sor
some Minutes more ·, then pour them into the melt-
ing Cone (Part Ι. Plate 11. Fzgg. XIX.) which 'must
be warni and rubbed with Tallow, and immediately
strike with a Hammer the Floor on which the Cone
stands·, that the heavier Part freed from the Sul-
phur may the sooner Sink to the Bottom ε Invert the
Cone when grown colel, and strike it. The Body
that was poured into it will fall out, and have at Bot-
tom a Regulus more or less yellow, according as there
was more or less Gold in the Mixture. This Regulus
may, with a gentle striking, be separated from the
sulphureous crust which is at Top.

2. Immediately after this, melt on a leffer Fire the
said Regulus in the same Crucible, if it is intire:
When in Fusion add to it the double Qantity of
¹gri-ude Antimony, and pour it out a.little aster. Se-
