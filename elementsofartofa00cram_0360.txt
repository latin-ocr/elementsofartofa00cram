The Examination of all Metstls that are destruc-
tible in the Fire‚ and above all that of Tin by Pre-
cipitation and Reduffion in close Veffels, is es<-
tremely decestful, · insomuch that the most experi-
enced Affayer‚ will most rarely find Regulus' s of a
perfeffly equal Weight, from one and the same O1·‚e
though it be comminuffl, and all the Particles well
mixt together, if he makes this Process several
Times over: For, the Ore or Calx of Tm, 18 refrastory
enough, when a Reduffion is to be completed‚ where-
fore, it requires a more violent Fire ς but, reduced
Tin, on the contrary, is most quickly destroyed
again by the same Fire. You may, indeed, in some
Mealhre·judge‚ whether an Ore is rich, poor, or
middling ; but you can hardly do it to a Pouncl τ
For, during the Operation, you have no certain
Sign, whether the Redufi‘cion and precipitation are
perfeet, or no : And have only meer Conjeehxres as
to. that. The saline Plux, which helps the Scorifi-
cation, has nothing to convert into Scoria but the
