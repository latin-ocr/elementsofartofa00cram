ASSAYING METALS'. 365
Nure, or of any fixt alcaiine Salt whatsoever‚ a

. quarter Part, with respec't to the crude Antimony ;

leave all these Things in the Fire for a few Minutes
more, that they may melt very tliin together ·‚ then
pour them into a melting Cone, in which, by striking
it, the wholereguline Mass contained in the crude Anti-
mony, will subside : Separate the Scoria’s which will
be hard : Expose them to a free and somewhat moist
Air, and in a few Days they will of themselves fall
into a Powder.

2. Put the Regulus a second Time into the Cru-
cible‚ add to it one quarter Part of fresh crude Anti-
mony, cover the Crucible with a Tile, and melt the
Matter with a Fire not violently excited: When the
whole is in Fufion‚ add at several Times one sixth
Part of Nitre‚ or very dry fixt alcaline Salt‚ and a
few Minutes after pour out the Mass weil melted.

3. The Regulus may be melted a third or a fourth
Time with a very little Nitre: This will detonate‚
and at the same Time assume a refractory Nature : If
at last you use the strongest F ire, your Regulus, when
poured out, will be finally marked with a δῖαν, but:
a great Portion of it wil] be consumed by the Nitre

and the Fire in these last F usions.

1. If you precipitare Regulus of Antimony‚ with
Metals (Part I. §147. Coroll. 3.) you will have
the Whole of it without any Loss3 but, it will be
tainted by a considerable Mixture of the precipitating
Metal: But, a greater Qantity of the Metal joins to
it, as the Action ofthe Sulphur upon it is ssower‚ and
as the Sulph-ur itself melts more easily with the Regu-
lus of Antimony. Thus, in every Precipitationc by
F usion of Metals by Means of other Meta13‚ the
precipitated Body partakes of the precipitating one,
except Lead alone, to which the Iron that precipitates

it never mixes; because both these Metals do not
dissolve each other in the Fire. The first ῗξζὶτςίζ
