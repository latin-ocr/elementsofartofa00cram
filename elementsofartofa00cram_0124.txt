Axis, with a delicate Pair of Pincers‚ the small
ringed Bow which is at the Extremity of this Arm z
Taking care mean while, not to raise or lower at
the same Time the Extremity of the Beam ε Other-
wise it would be but substituting the first <N⁰ 1.) or
the second (N0 2.) Fault‚ to the Fault correered.
'Therefore‚ this being done, take away the small
ashes, and, by taking something of the granulate d
Lead‚ which you had put before into the other Scede,

restore the Equilz'brium, which had been wanting an
the while: For then the Arm of the Bean] which had
been raised befor‚e will certainly be low red. Then
again put the small Dilhes into the Sczsses, and if you
do not find a11217b7 m, restore it, by putting
granulated Lead i1 to either ol the Di 'shesz Which
done, inter-change the sa il Dissies·, and you will see
from the W ant ot Eq2‚ilibrizc m, which of the Arms of
the Eram is still longer than requisita⁴ : If you find
‘it to be so ζ», men-d. the Fault as before, that is, by
ssiortening the lowered Arm, or by lengthening that
which is raise‘l, having always an Attention to the
Clutions already prescribed Repeat these manual
Operations over and over, till the Balance unloaded,

and equipoised either of itself‚ 01· by Means of granu-

lated Lead put into either of the Scales‚ rnay undergo
theinterchanging of the small DisheS‚ withoutdisturb-

ing the Equilibrium. ·For then both the Arms of the
Beam will be of eq ual Ι ength. lf after that, the first
Defest, that consisted m the Inequality of the Scales‚

remains still, 1t may be removed m the Manner above-

mentioned. The Causes of the other Faults being
more senfible, may of course be more eafily mended ε
Therefore, we leave it to the Skill of the Artificer,
to dete& and corre& thern.

270. I ssmll, in favour of such as would try to
make the Scales themselves, add the following Di-
rectionS. 1. The whole Beam together with its
Tongue, must be cut out ofone and the same Plate
of Steel : For any soldered Bit may be eafily sepa·

rated, because this Beam musts be worked withgxtra-
