fi’'Cement. Wh'en the Veffels have been red-hot for
Ῑῐίκεεεη or twenty Hours‚ take away the F ire, that
‘ the whole may cool of itself.

4. This done, open the Pom, take out the Ce-
ment, which must be softened by pouring Water up-
on it, in case it should have hardened too much. If
there has been any Silver in the Mixture‚ you must
preserve the Cement‚ as it contains in it the Metal
which has been corroded from the Gold. After this,
pour upon the Plates of Gold a little Water‚ to wash
them clean, then make them boil in other Water,
which you are to renew several Times, till it is per-

fectly insipid: For, there are saline Spirits, that lie ,

hidden in the Plates of Gold, together with the Me-
tal corroded by them. After that, try the Gold
with the Touch-stone‚ or more surely still, by Qiar-
,tation, whether it hasthe Degree of Purity which
you defire ·, unless you already know it, from a Series
of repeated Experiments.

5. Ifyour Gold is not yet sufficiently pure, cernent
it anew once or twice more. Workmen commonly
add some Salt-ammoniac to the foregoing Cement‚
that the other Metals may be the eafier corroded:
But in this Case, there must be no Colcothar among
the Ingredients‚ for it sometimes happens that Gold
cannot be brought to a sufficient Degree of Purity, on
account chiefly of the Copper which it is commonly
mixt with.

‘she Ost and Reasons of the Proccss.

1. This Process shews‚ that the Action of the Spi-
rit of common Salt is different, according to its dif-
ferent Purity, and the different Degrees of the F ire.
Likewise‚ if, instead of common Salt, you imploy
Nitre in the Cement‚ the Spirit of it being disen-
gaged, consumes the Silver distributed in the greatest
Part of the Gold τ Which Effe& it could not pro-
duce‚' even the moist Way, though it constituted

two Thirds of the Mixture of Silver and Gold. F gr
