(§216.) upon the Cylinder just described, which
must be turned all the while upon its Axis with the
Handle. By this Means, your Metal made 1111111161,
than after the foregoing Manner (ξ 216.) will be
comminuted into thin Plates rolled together.

Scholion. By both these Methods (ᾗ 216, and 217.)
combined, you may very well and with Security grami-
late Gold, Silver, and the3 several metallick Mixtures .·
But there is always some Risk in the granulating of Cop-
per: To avoid which, you must pour it only in a finall
Qtantity, and with a fhmll Stream .· thz'ch is'more
securely done, tf the Transfuston is made through a red
hot C rucible‚ having a few small Hales at bellom ·, that
the Copper being as it were previoussy divided by this
straming, may thus fall upon the Broorfz (ξ 216.) ον upon
the Cylinder (ᾗ 217). ’

2 18.The Cement-Pots are cylindrical Veffils, made
of Potter's Clay, with Tiles adapted to thern, and
turned by Potters. The Size of these Veffels must be
proportioned to the Qantity of Cement to be put
(ᾗ 153.) into them. However, it is not proper to
make them above eight or ten Inches broad : For
when larger, the Fire ads with Difficulty and In·
equality, especially in the Middle of them.

219. You are to observe, that in the making of
these Earthen Veffels (ᾗ 218.) and of their Covers,
all kinds of Clay contra& and take up a lesser Space
in the drying and baking: Insomuch however, that
the purer Clay coatrae& one tenth Part of its Dia-
meter: But the more it is mixt with Sand, or some
other Dust of Stones and Veffels already baked, the
less it diminilhes3 this Diminution being sometimes
hardly perceptible. Therefore, if a Veffel, or a Co-
ver, of a determined Size is to be made of Clay ·‚ it
must be made greater than the required Bark, in
proportion to t'ne Diminution‚ which Experience
teac'hes you, Clay, either crude or prepared, under-
goes in the drying up of it.
