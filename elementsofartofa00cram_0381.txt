third Part. Stop the Orifice at Top; this must be
very nari-ow, to hinder the free Ac'tion of the Ais:
Pur this small Cucurbite in an earthen-Pot above
two lnches wide in Diameter, and gather Sand around
this Por, about aas high as the pulverized Ore risos
in the Cucurbite: Then put upon it burning Coals in
such Manuer that the Bottom of the Pot may be
middling red hot: Thus will your Cinnabar ascend,
and form a solid ponderous Ring, which must be got
out by breaking the Veffel. Obstrve, that if you
have pure Cion-abar, whether Fastitious or Native,
you must separate from it the superfluous Sulphur
which has not been thoroughly mixt with the Mercury:
This may be done very well by putting your pulve-
rized sulphurated Mercury into a Cucurbite‚ and by
exposing it to a Fire not much greater than that which
is requisite to sublime common Sulphur: Thus will
your superfluous Sulphur ascend with a little Mermry,
and form a black Crust all over the Cavity of the
Veffel. For Sulphur and Mercury aremuch more vo-
latile when separate, than the Cinnabar made of both.
This Sublimation must also be performed suddenly
with a strong Fire3 nor are you to sear any Danger
from it, provided you take Care that the upper-Part
of the Veffel be not exposed to an exceffive Heat3
especially if you mike Use of a small Matras : For,
by that Means the narrow Osifice of it may be stom,
and the Vcsst} bren-ilc azsunder with great Violence.
