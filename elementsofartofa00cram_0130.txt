Weight just described (ξ 282.) ifyou can substitute to
it a Weight of sixteen Pounds of the docimastical
Centner (ᾗ 274, 277.) for if this represents the entire

284. To temper Silver with Copper, the Mark is
likewise divided into sixteen halfOunces, as (ᾗ 283.)
But the half Ounce is then divided into eighteen Parts,
which they call Grana or Graius, but Georg. Agricola in
better Latin ca‘lls them Quaternas Siliquas, and finally
the Grain is divided into four Qarters. Therefore
in this Case, the greatest Weight is the Mark, or
half Pound, which weighs about half a Dram of the
common Weight: The second is half-Ounces‚ the
third is four3 the fourth two 3 the fifth one 3 thet
