, 5. Itis proper here to mention the Danger occa-
sioned by a fortuitous or imprudent Application of
Waten or ofa moist, nay, of a merely cold Body,
to melted Copper ³⁸2 For, ff all Metals there is
none that scatters with so great a Violence all the
Things round it, as melted Copper, especially boil-
ing purified Copper, called in German &abtdssupfcm
insomuch, that the Fall of a Coal‚ or ofa small
moist or cold Stone, has often broken asunder whole
Furmces, and burned whole Laboratories: And this
happens especially, if but a small Qantity of Wa-
ter extended wide, touches a large Surface of Copper.
Likewffe, 'Copper that does begin to grow solid,
being thrown on a moist, cold, but especially wide
Surfuoe, flies about with great Danger to those that
stand by, and of settjng the Building on Fire. Where-
ibre, if you' have not a Mind to be exposed to the
same Dauger, you must take Care in the Granulation
'of Copper by water, that it may flul from a ssoap-
ing Surface, or through a hored Veffel, and with a.
small Stream, into Walter that is stirred about with
great Force.

choly Accident of this Kind happened at the brass—Foundery at
Windmill-hill near Moorfields‚ Laneion, about twenty Years ago, when
several People of Qality were invited to see the Cafling of two
large brass* Cannons at a Time ; the Heat of the Metal of the first
Gun drove so much Damp into the Mould of the second, which
was near it, that as soon as the Metal was let into it, it blew up
with the greatest Violence, tearing up the Ground some Feet deep,
breaking down the Furnace‚ untiling the House, killing many of
the Spestators on the Spot with the streams of melted Metal,
and scalding many others in a most miserable Manner. Ι
