through the Crucible like water, and falls down In

Drops into the Affi-hole: When you see this, you
must immediately take the Veffels out of the F ire, if

you are not willing to lose all. Having broken the
Crucible‚ you most commonly find a small 'Regulus
of Lead, reduced by the Fatness of the Salt‚ or os
the impure Nitre: In the Middle is the Glass of Lead,
which is to be separated and kept for use, the saline
Cake which is at top must be thrown away.

55. If you use Clay or Potter’s Earth, or the Ca-
put Mortuum of Vitriol wash’d, you make likewise
excellent Glass with vLitharge ; only you are to take

care not to add too great a Qantity of these Things;
for when Litharge is too much saturated, it cannot

consume the Bodies to be separated from the MetalS.
The Glass likewise becomes uselesS‚ when Part of the
Litharge runs through the Veffels. This Damage
proceeds either from the Crucible’s not being solid e·
nough, or from the mechanical Mixture's having been

ne lected.

that its Vapour, if it touches even the best Gold, ren-

ders it brittle‚

57. See the Description of it (ξ 10.) Tin eafily
melts with Silver, Gold, and Copper3 but when
they are melted with it in equal or less Quanrsty, it
renders them extremely brittle3 especially Silver,
which becomes as brittle as Glass by the least Mix-
ture of Tin. But if a much greater Qantity of it
enters into metallick Masse5‚ these still preserve some
Pliantness: For instance, ten Parts of Tin, and one
Part of Copper melted together, make a Mass more
rigid than pure Tin, but which is still somew'nat
tractable: By this Artifice, they make Utenfils of
Tin that are much more durable. If you add to
Copper ten Parts of Tin, and a little Brass or
Zink together, this will produce a brittle and very

sonorous Metal, fit for making of Bells and CannonS.
