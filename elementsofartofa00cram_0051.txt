pour drop by drop into the rest of the Aqua Fortis
that is to be purified: This will become milky as
before3 they continue to instil the Aqua Fortis, till
¹ the dropping in of the smallest Drop doth not at all
disturb it or render it milky: Then they let it rest
for some Hour3‚ that the precipitated Calx may sub.
fide, which done they again let a Drop fall, and re-
peat it constantly, till at last the milky Cloud is no
longer produced by the Falling of the Drop. Fi-
nally, they decant the pure and *limpid Aqua Fortis,
from the Calx which subsided at the Bottom 3 or they
strain it gently through a fourfold filtring Paper,
which ought to be small, lest it should break, by be.-
ing overloaded with too much of the Aqua Fortis.
The remaining Calx is such as was mentioned (ξ 12 1.)
but the Aqua Fortis is perfestly purified.

Scholion. Some are uftd to employ common Silver
mixed with Copper, nczy Copper itself, for the precipi-
tatingof the spirit of marine or vitriolick Salt from Aqua
Fortis : But this does not at allsucceed² when spirit of
marine Salt is to be precipitated, because this being mixed
with Aqua Fortis diffolves Copper perfcffly. The Oil
of Vitriol is indeed driven out of Aqua Fortis, by means
of the Copper, inform of a whitifh Dust 3 but not st)
perfeffly as by Silver. Otherwise, it appears in this
Operation that the precz'pz'tating Body adheres to that to be
precipitated, cmdssnks to the Bonam together with it.

123. The best Aqua Forlis is often tinged with a
greenish Colour: Which happens, if Aqua Fortis
having been exposed for some Days to the open Ais,
and thus deprived of its fuming red Spirit‚ you pour
int}³ (ἔξω rii ess c? moe r ξὲεἳῳῗιῑῖἳὲίέᾳίζαόῇῖἔέ sitililthexlhlgig}
But that you may be certain that this Colour does
not proceed from Copper, pour a little of the Liquor
into a small Cucurbite, and add to it as much of an
alcaline Diffolution or Spirit, as is sufficient to saltui-ate
the Acid : Then, ifthere is ever so little Copper, the
Colour becomes of a very dark Azure, with a cloudy
Precipitation 3 because the Nix-e has been therehy
