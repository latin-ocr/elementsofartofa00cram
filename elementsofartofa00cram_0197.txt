all CountrieS, and that some Places are more proper,
some lesS, for ereffing Salt-petre Works. It is like-
wise plain, that most probably the Air is either the
instrumenta] or the material (lause, or perhaps both
together, of the Generation of Nitre‚ or at least car-
ries it in its Bosom. For you infallibly hinder the
Generation of N itre by obstructing the Paffage of the
Air. The Reason is likewise plain, why the East
and North-Winds are so beneficial to the Places
where Nitre grows, in those Regions‚ and in the
Climates between thern, especially during the Spring
«ancl the Autumn 3 while on the contrary, the West
and South-Winds are quite unproduffive of it. For
it has been observed, that, in the Spring and Autumn—
time‚ the East and North-Winds are neither too
-moist nor too dry‚ especially during the Night ; and
that being too drying in Winter ancl &muner-time,
they parch every thing. But the south and westerly
Winds, being stormy, and bringing Rains along
with them, are there very hurtful: however, it is
well worth our Inquiries, nor have we hitherto found
out by Experiments sufficiently accurate, whether
these Winds are detrimental to the nitrous Mamer,
merely by an exceffive Mollior-e, or (suppofing this
to be preventecl) are hurtful to it upon some. other

ments in these Mamers, and to do it easily, and with
little Apparatus, might procuret himselfa Nitre-house,
by exposing in a proper Place (ᾖ 439.) the Matter in
which it is (ᾗ 438.) ingendered. An Example will
clear this Point. Chuse any Place quite open to ther
Air: However, a Fielcl or a Garden will be best.
Upon the Area of it, which must be eight Foot long,
and as much broad and deep, build a small Hut of
Mad, having its Top thatched with Straw, and
ssoaping, to lhelter it from the filling Rains: Let γ
the I-Ieight of it from the Ground be such, that a
