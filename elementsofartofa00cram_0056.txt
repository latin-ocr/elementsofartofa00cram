131. Borax‚ or Chrysocolla‚ (Gold-Sodder) is a Sale
very difficult to be diffolved in Water. *It is white,
somewhat transparent‚ confisting of ofto’e'dral Cry-
stals·, having a sweetish Flavour at first, and in the
End an alkaline urinous After taste Borax exposed
to the Fire‚ is raised into Spume With a hiffing.
Noise, when at last the Veffel grows red hot, it be-
comes a thin Fluid‚ and then growing cold it looks
like very fine Glaziss However1t is at any time disso-

Scholion Borax being ſs) apt to foam and fioell on the
Ere, it is very proper to mele it before it is used3 lest it
fhould rise over the Veffils.

132. All Eaiths and Stones‚ well mix ’d and
pounded together with Boram, dissolve into Glass of
different Species,

133. Borox forwards very much the melting of
Metals difficult to be put in Fufi0n‚ as are Gold, Sil-
ων, Coppa, Iron, Regulus of Antimony, and dimi-
nishes thern very little. When, therefore, Metals are
dispersed, or divided into very minute Parts‚ retain-
ing however their metallick Form, and are then to be
again reduced into one single Mass by Fire, Borax is
ofvery great Use. Dirt and Athes‚ though 1n ever so
finall a Qantity, will certainly hitider small Particles
of Gold and Silvo from melting eafily into one single
Mass. But if they are so disposed by a very strong
’1 ire, as to me lt into Regulus, a great Part of the Me-
tal will always adhere to the ssightest Filthiness that is
flung away Bit the viler kinds of Metals notdonly
