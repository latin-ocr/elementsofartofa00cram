do not extra& Iron out of it. It is called in German

353. There is alio, but especially m tin-Mines,
a kind of striated Ore, made of Filaments of an ir-
regular Texture, and dark coloured, which, when
scraped, appears sometimes of a Clark red Colour ε it
is ponderous enough, and likewise contains Iron, but
it is at the same Time very arsenical ·, on which Ac-
count it is always rejected by Metallurgists, as being
very prejudicial. The Germans call it monstram,

354. We shall also class here the Oker of Iron,
which seems to have its Origin from comminuted
¹ iton-Ore, and especially from the yellow Pyrites de-
stroyed. It looks like a kind of fattish Earth, it has
the Colour of Rust, which nevertheless is rendered
sometimes yellow, sometimes clarkes, by a Mixture
of other Earths·, this occafions a Variety in the
Weight of this Oker. It is found both in dry and
marssiy Places, it forms here anci there whole Veins
and Strata, and is likewise found, though impure, in
almost every Place, as in Marls, Cluys, and Boles.
This Oker is so very rich of Iron in several PartS‚
that it answers equally the Charges of extracting, as
the best ison—Ore. ··

355. Red-Lead, or redChalk, seems to be cles-
cended from this kind (25 354.) of Oker, and to have
been hardened by a Mixture of Bole and Clay. It is
