Time a proportionablefPart of the Salt, answering
to the remaining Qantity of the Menstruum. Let
us take for an Instance the salt, alkaline, Ashes of
Woods: pour upon them hot Water; make this
boil together with them for some Time 3 and then by
Decantation or Straining‚ separate the Lye from the
rest ε There will remain at least one quarter Part of
the Lye among the Ashes ς and of Course also a pro-
port10nable small Part of the diffolved Salt itself:
pour fresh Water a second Time, and decant it: A
Qantity of Salt‚ though much less confiderable, will
for the same Reason again remain ·, and so on for
ever. For which Reason‚ this Operation must be
repeated, at least so often as that there remains but a
very small and insenfible Portion of Salt.

Coroll. Hence, the Reason is plain, why Calxs of
Gold and Silver made with Acids‚ are so frequently
renuet-d with great Loss ε for the Acids as yet ad-
hertng, being agitated by an impetuous and especially
an open Fire, carry a great Quantity of Metal away
with them3 not even excepting Aqua Portis itself εμ
which nevertheless‚ is said to be, and in reality is of
a fixing Nature, but that only with certain Limits.

476. Precipitation is called moist‚ in German
ᾖξῆῑιαης, when a Body, which has been diffolved
(ᾗ 471.) the moist way, is again driven out of the
Diffolvent, so as either to swim in the Menstruum, or

, ”to s1nk to the Bottom of it: which most commonly

looks like Powder 3 but the Separation of the Men-
‘struum from the Body precipitated‚ is afterwards
performed by either decandng, or filtrating. -
· 477. This Operation (ς 476.) is pc.lormed‚ either
by extracting‚ or evaporating in a gentle Fire, the
diffolving Menstruum out of the fixt diffolved Body ς
or by adding such a Body, as is greedily diffolved by
that Menstruum : as if one Metal diflolved in an
Acid, is precipitated by another Metal, or by alka-
line Salt3 for Instance, Silver diffolved in Aqua
Fortis, precipitated by Copper, Copper by Iron,
(Iron, by Zink, and all Metals and Semi-Metals either
