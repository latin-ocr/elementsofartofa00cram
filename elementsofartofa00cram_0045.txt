99. Iron, Copper, Tin, and Semi-Metaik, being
melted with this Salt of Oil made very ffiarp, are.v
more ssowly consumed. Befides‚ Alcali promotes
very much the melting by F ire of Iron, Copper‚ and
the Regulus of Antimony .· But not that of Tin,
Lead, Bismuth, and Zink3 as these melt eafier than
salt itself.

100. Mercury refists Alcaly altogether, nor canit
be mixt with it by any Method that is known. This
therefore is to be entirely avoided -in the Preparation
of Metals for an Amalgama (§ 6 5).

101. What kind of fixt Alcali, whether mixt with
pure oily Matter, or with mineral Sulphur, is to be
preferred, we shall point out hereaster, when we treat
of compound Menstrua, Flux’s, Cernents, &c 3
having hitherto explained only the simplet Species
of thern.

102. But the fixt Alcali, being, as it were, a dry
Menstruum, serves chiefly to reduce the Calx of Me·-
tals‚ that have been reduced by Acids. For Acids,
adhering to Metals‚ and being driven away violently
by a Fire carried to an excesfive Degree 3 they hurty
a confiderable Qantity of thern away with them-
selves: And if they are obliged, by adding more of
the fixt already, to pass first, whatever metallick
Matter they carry with them is absorbed and fixt:
that by this Means the Calx of Metals, made in-
tirely volatile by Acids, especially by that of Sea-Sam
may be reduced without Loss: Which cannot be con-
veniently effected by adding other Men rua.

¹03· There is hardly any Neceffity, here to men-

tion the volatile Alcali; it being very seld0m‚ if
ever, neceffary in affaying.

Of Aeros, confidered crs Menstrua.

104. Acids are employed by Affayers, either the
moist or the dry Way, and according to the several
Methods used, produce different Effeufts. Among
these Acids occur, Ν, The vegetable Acids, of
