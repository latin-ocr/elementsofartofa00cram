ASSAYtNG METALS. 269‘

you will be able to deteet, by Needles of the white
Allay, the Temper of the Residue of Silver and
Gold, with still greater Accuracy, than at first by the
Needles of the mixt Allay. If you then weigh the
remaining Regulus, you know how much Copper
there was in the Mixture. This Trial may be made
previously, to know how much Silver must be added
still, to prepare an Entrance for the Aqua Fortis into
the Mixture.

2. Likewise‚ you must, for the Examination of
your Gold, separate two SpecimenS, stric'tly observing
the Cautions prescribed (Proc. XII. ΝΟ. 1, 2), if the
Circumstances require it. Let each of them weigh

. half a Mark: Put both severally into two Coppels

well heated, and perform the Coppelling with a suffi-
cient uantity of Lead. When there is a Corusca-
tion, add one Centner more of granulated Lead, and
such a Qantity of the purest Silver, as that it may,
together with the Silver already found in the Mixture

. (ΝΟ. 1.) be threefold with regard to the Gold. We

shall illustrate this Matter with an Example. Let us
suppose, according to the Trial (ΝΟ. 1.) that the half
Mark has lost four Carats of its VVeight in the Cop-
pelling : Substra& thern from the half Mark : There
will remain eight Caram, which constitute the Gold
and Silver alone: Let them be rubbed upon the
Touch-stone, and agree with the Needle of the
white Allay, which is marked with eighteen Carats
of Gold, that is, in which one Part of Silver is mixt
with three Parts of Gold z You thence know, that
there are in the remaining Regulus of eight Carats„
one quarter Part, that is, two Carats of Silver, and

three Qarters, that is, fix Carats of Gold. As
then there must be three Times more Silver than Gold

in the Mixture 3 add sixteen Carats of Silver, which

together with the two Carats already in the Mixture,
make eighteen CaratS. ”

’ 3. Moreover‚ rnelt the Mixture in a Coppel, with
the same Cautions as in Proc. XXIV. then reduce
it to small Plates rolled up, and dissolve it in the

same
