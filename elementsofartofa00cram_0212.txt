471. We call Solutions moist, when a Body is dis-
tributed through the very minutest Particles of an
aqueous, or in great part aqueous Fluid, in such
Manner that both may turn into a Fluid to Appear-
ance homogeneous, which goes through all F ilters
without being detained in thern, and the smallest Part:
of which contains in it a proportionable Quantity of
both the dissolvent and the diffolved Body. The So-
lution of Col l in Aqua Regis ·, that of Silver in Aqua
1⁴ πιέν, and ῑὴῑῖ of all Sz'zlts m plain water, are so
many such moist Solutions.

472. That kind of moist Solution, by which Sil-
ver is sepirated from Gold by Aqua Fortis, is called
in Latin Qcartatio *‚ and deserves a particular Con-
fideration. lf, for Instance, Silver and Gold are con-
founded ιη one Mass, and the Gold is not less than
one third Part of the whole Mass with regard to the
Weight: then the best Aqua Fortis poured upon it
is not capable ofdiffolving the Silver. · but if you add
more Silver to this Mass meltis· g in the Fire3 then
indeed Aqua Fortis pouied upon it, when it is grown
cold, will corrode the Silver from it: which is also

the more strono gly performed, as the Qantity of the
Gold is less than one third Part of the whole Mass.

’ But Experience has taught us, that Aqua Fortis dis-

solves Silver mixt with Gold quickly enough, when
'the Gold constitutes but one, and the Silver three
*quarter Parts of the Mass: Nay, if the Solution is
not too impetuoussy performed, the Gold commonly
retains in such a Proportion, without any Alteration,
the same Figure which the whole Mass had before
the Diffolution3 so that in this Case there is no Rea-
·> son to apprehend, that the Gold torn into minute
, Particles will be diffipatedin part : which can hardly
'be prevented, when the Silver exceeds the three
‹quarter Parts of the Mass with regard to the Gold.
