so soon as it is perfeffly liquid, pour it at once into a
woodcn Veffel having a wooden Cover, or some other
Veffel in which a Fluid may be very strongly shaken,
without however any danger ofits running out. But
let the Sides ofthe Veffel be well rubbed with Chalk·
or Wax3 then let it be thoroughly ssmken, so that
the I ead agitated within, may dash strongly against
the Sides ot the Veffe13nor do you cease this Motion,

till it becomes solid: You will find the greater Part
of the Laui, divided into very small porous Graius.
Let then the Chalk that sticks to it be washed off,

thenhft the Grains, to n 11<e them equal, dry them,

and k'eep the η] fxom the Dust in a clean Veffel, for
the Uses hereafter to be expllined.

Scholion Ι. The Reoson of doing thus is this. There*
are among Metals some, as Leuci, Tin, (md Brasj, which
when ready to melt, are extremely brittle, like wetted 2
gravel. T he Cholle wherewith the Instde is rubbed over,
gives the Sursace a vzzst reststing Force‚ and prestrves it
from bitrning. Now, if the melted Lead be shaken and
dashed against the Sides oflhe Veffi’l in the Manner afore-
stiel, the Mimtteit begins to become fhlid, the Mass at that
M oinent bei ig of the utmost Brittlemss, is fhivered into a
minute Dust, ‘cclich can hardly be obtained any otherwfie
th ‘ln by this manual Operation.

Scholion II. There are Cautions to be taken. Fstst,
Let the Lead nothe melted by too great a Fire; for this
occasions a* thim Skin on the Surface, which though taken
away is immediately fitcceeded by another, which mixing
with the Lead during the fhoking‚ hiriders very much the
Success of the Operation‚ it being too tenacious. Secondly,
Let the Lead be filfficientlyflitid ·‚ lest the Maſs, so spon as
pourec'i m, should wax cold before it might be broken to

ieces.
p Corollary. It 18 then plain, that this Granulation
cannot be made with such Metals‚ as are more tena-
cious in proportion as they are nearer being melted,
