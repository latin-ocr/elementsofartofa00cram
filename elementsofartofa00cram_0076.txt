part of theNDepth of the Ring, and again fill the
Vacuity with the sameAshes (§ 185. N01, 2), in such
a Mamer, that there may remain no senfible Cavi-

( 182.)The Tests, called in German ffreihstijethen,
are Veffeis refisting the strongest Fire, and so vastly
conspuet, that sometimes they not only retain melted
Meltals, but also the very Glaſs· of Lead itself.

187. Their Figure ancl Size may be the same as
that of the Coppels: However they commonly are
made larger. To form them, they use a wooden
or brass-Mould‚ represented (Plat. I. Frg. V. and VI.)
Nor is there any Difference between a Coppel and a
Test, except that the Matter of the latter must be
more compa& and coherent.

188. The Matter fit for the making of Tests is
prepared thus : (1.) Make into Balls, Clay of the
best kind, an'd pure·‚ and dry thern in the Air, or
in the Fire: When dried, pound them in a Mortar:
Pour upon this Earth abundance of warin Water·,
let this Mixture rest a while3 and when the Clay has
subsided‚ pour out the Water which swirns at top.
The sanie VVashing may be repeated, that all the
mintitc Lurnps of the Clay rnay be well soaked with
water, and any thing of Salt contained in them be
washed off, (2.) Then add of the pnrest Sand, of
Powder of calcined Flints ground, and well waffied,
of faulty but clean Hcffian Crucibles, or of any in-
combustihle δίον-τω ground very fine, such Qantity
as will render the Mass thick, hardly adhering to
the Hand of hirn that kneeds it, and hardly pliant
when reduced into a small Lamina. This Mass will
be fit for the making of Tests.

189. Eut, before you make a great Qantity of
Tests with this Earth (ᾗ 188.) it will be proper first
to put into a single one made with it, a Qantity of
Giris} aff lead, and to expose it for an Hour or
more to the strongest F ire. Thus you will bel suge,
