p. 581. Which Fraud is not always easily detefoed:
Neverffieless, it is often known from too great a,
specifick Graviry, from an exceffive Roughness‚ and
srom the Want of a quick Diffolution in Acids. But,

PR OCESS LXVI.
The Cementation and Fufion of Copper with Zink·ore.

APPARATUS.

’ ΛΚΕ of Zink—ore, for Instance, of Calamina

reduced to Powder‚ one Part and a half, and as
much of comminuted Charcoal·, grind them toge-
ther, and moisten them slightly with Water :Fill
any melting Vessel with this Mixture, put between
and at top Plates of the purest Copper one part, and
again cover them with Charcoal—dust, and put the
Whole in a wind-Furnace, covering it with a great
Qantity of Charcoal 3 light them by ssow Degrees‚
and then increase the F ire, to make the Veffel grow
white-hot: When you see a Flame tinged with a
grey‚ bluish, or purple Colour3 try here and there
with a strong iron-Wire‚ whether the Copper is
melted under the Charcoal-dust: Which is done with
a much leffer Fire, than Copper alone requires for
the F usion of it : Then moderate your F ire, that it
may not be too violent: Finrdly, having continued
the F usion a little longer, let the Veffel be taken out
of the Fire, that it may cool of itself, or let
the melted Mass it contain3‚ if confiderable, be
poured out into a dry and middling—warm Veffel:
You will find, when you break the Copper, that
it is tinged with a golden Colour‚ and that the
Weight of it is increased a considerable Qanffly,
which is sometimes one quarter or one third Part of

the Weight of the Copper made use of, its Mal-Ilea-
