ASSAYIN'G METAL'S‘. 73

224. But when a small Mass of precipitated Metal

is forthwith and entirely to be put into a Coppel 3
they chuse to use a Mould, haVIng the Form ofa Seg-
rnent of a little Sphere, and made likewise of [ron3
such as is commonly employed in pouring out such
Ores as have been extracted and scorificated by Lead.
By this Means you are sure to hinder the small me-
tallick Mass, from scraping with its angulous Sur-
face any Particle of the tendet· Bottom of the Cop-
pel, while it is put into it, and, by this MeanS,
from making it rough.
ἲ 225. All these Moulds (ξ 221, and 224.) must be
well heated, before the Metal is poured into them 3
lest -they should happen to be a little Wet, or con-
tra& a Moisture‚ especially in cold Weather, by the
sudden Heatof the melted Mass being poured into
them : In which Case, the Matter poured in is often-
times disploded with very great Danger.

226. Moreover‚ they must be previoussy smeered
over with Tallow, that the Regulzts’s may be more
eafily taken out of them, and that the Cavity of the
Moulds may not be corroded, by the Mass poured into
them. But if a very great Qiantity of Metal is to
be poured out, especially ofa very sulphureous Me-
tal, or by means of precipitate of Sulphur3 the
smeering of the Cone or of the Mor-tar with Tallaw,
is hardly sufficient, to prevent the Corrolion just :rw-n-
tioned : Because the large Mass of the Matter petir-
edin, remains hot for a considerable while. There-
fore, in this Case they use a Line, redum d tr.) a thin
Pap, with Warer, which being applied very [hin to
the Infide of the Cone, or of the Mei-tar, is alter-
wards dried up. Thus, by means of this Cmst„ the
Action of the Sulphur upon the Metal of the Cone
is certainly prevented. Nay, pure Copper itself,
though it be rnelted with no Sulphur‚ operares some-
thing like this: Wherefore‚ it is necessary in this
Case to use the said Precaution.
