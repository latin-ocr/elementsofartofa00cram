ASSAYING METALS. 363

add a Phlogiston‚ the vitriolated Salt ad-
hering to it, turns to Liver of Sulphur, which dis—
solves the Regulus, and in very great Part retains it
joined to itself. Nor can you, however, thus ob—
‘tam so much Regulus, as when the Calcination is
made either by itsclf‚ or with only adding a Phlo-
giston ε For during so violent a Detonati0n‚ a great
Qantity is flung, out of the Veffel, or vanilhes away
into Fumes : Resides, some Part of the reguline Sub-
stance is also washed off along with the Salt ; which
is very plain, when you pour wine-Vinegar upon
the VVater wherewith the Edulcoration has been
made: By Means of which you precipitato a red
Powder, called Sulphur Auratum, which is composed
of the Sulphur of your Antimony joined to the semi-
metallick Part. For, the Phlogiston of the crude
Antimony, is not totally consnrned by an equalWeight
of Nitre : But, if you add twice or thrice as much
Nitre ; then indeed, it is totally consumed ε How-
ever‚ 'a semi-metallick Part remains so strictly united
with the Salt‚ that it runs through the Filtei‘s. As
this last part is obtained out of the warm Diffoluti0n‚
in the same Manner as the Lac Sulphuris and the Sul-
phur Auratum are got by Precipitation ·, it has been
butiinproperly called fixtSulphur of Antimony : For
it is deprived of all inflammable Mamer, on which
Account it is of a white Colour. It is for the same
Reason‚ that the Sulphur called fixtSulphur of An-
timony, being meltecl with a very strong Fire, turns
into (nass, of a much lighter Colour‚ and less vio-
lent in its Effefts, than that which is made of Crocus
of Antimony, because it is almost the same as Glass
made with Calx of Antimony procured without any
Addition. .

3. Frorn what has been said the Reason is plain,
why simple Regulus of Antimony is prepared with
some Loss the ordinary Way. For a Mixture
of Tartar, Nitre, and crude Andmony, detonates
in a strong melting Fire 3 but seizes upon the Nitre,

which reduces the Phlogiston oftheTartar as well ‘as th}
