PROCESS XLV.

Examination of the Smriffls of the foregoing Proccjffes
concerning Copper.

APPARATUS.

F the Scoria is much charged with Sulphur, beat

two or three docimastical Centners of it to a sub-
tile Powder‚ and mix it, either alone, or, if its re-
frac'lory Nature requires it, with some very fusible,
common, pounded Glass, without a reducing saline
Flux, and meh it in a: close 'x'effeh and in a Fire
having a Draught ofAir‚ as in Proc. XLII: You
will have a Regulus like that Prot. XLII.

But when the Scoria has little or no Sulphur at all
in it, take one Centneror' it, and with the black Flux
manage it as you do the suhble copper-Ore
{ProcssXXXVIfi You will have a pure Regulus.

But, if you have a Minci to try a greater Qan—
tity of Soeria, perform the Operation according to
Proc. XLI.

1. While Metals are precipitated by Scorification,
and with a melting Fire‚ out of the solid Bodies in
which they are inclosed, the ὃσα-ἱείς, on account of
their Clamminess, most commonly retain something
of the Metal (Part Ι. § 98. Schol.) .· Belides, when
the inst Qantity of Phlogiston {s wanting, and the
Fire is either too strong br of too long Duration, a
great Deal of the already precipitated Regulus’s of the
Metals of an imperfe& Mixture‚ being half-vitrified,
turns to Scoria’s again z Lilzewise, the Excess of Sui-
phur and Arsenick is oftentimes an Obstacle to a suf-
ficient Precipitation‚ especially when precipitating
Matters are wanting, or misapplied: Finally, the
Destruffibility of the Metal itse1f‚ hinders one from
