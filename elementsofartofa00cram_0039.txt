ASSAYING METALS. 23

73. Lead mix’d with Arsenick is immediately and
partly carried away, in the Form of a thick Smoak,
the rest being a thin Glass ofa Saffron colour.

74. Silver is penetrated by Arsenick applied in the
same (ς 7ο.) manner, and loses its Malleability3 but
it vanilhes away by a great Fire, in the Form of
Smoak.

75. Gold penetrated by Arsenick, becomes infinite-
ly brittle, it loses its Colour, and then being snddenly
thrown in a great Fire, Part of it is sublimed.

Scholion. Arss'ffzz‘ck, on account of this Property, is cal-
led Sul phur rapax: Because, hy its Afflion excited with
Fire and Air, there is often a greater Qtantity of Metals
raised and fitblz'med in form ef Flowers up the thrimces,
them is colleeeed in z'he very melting Pois of the Furnaces
themſslves. Howwer, the solid Matter thus sublimed is
called Cadmia fornacum,

762 Finally, Arsenick is attracsted with a different.
Force by different: MetalS‚ and attraCOE thern recipro-
cally. Of all Metals it absorbs Iron most greedily‚
and succeffively Copper‚ Tin, Lead, and Silver.
Therefore all Metals may be freed of the Foulness of
Arst’nick by Iron, but not so well by Scorz‘ae of Iron,
unless the Fufion be made in an open Fire: For then
Scorioe may be usefully imployed, because though they
do not of themselves absorb the Arfi’m'ck, they never-
theless being reduced to Iron, a& in the same Man-
ner as Iron itsell‘. Now we shall soon lhew, that they
may be reduced to it, by the means already mention-

ed.

Of AN TtMoNv.

77. The Regulus (ᾗ 16.) ofAmimmqv, when melt-
ed by a great Fire, proves totally volatile. In the
Fire, itbubbles almost like Lea-¹1², and diffolves into a
kind of Glass not very fix'd, while [he rest vanishes
inta Smoak.

78. The same renders all Bodies hitherto known
volatile, Gold on certain Condltions excepted.
