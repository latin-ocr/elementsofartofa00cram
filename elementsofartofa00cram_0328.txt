302 The ART os

3. Break the V effel, when grown cold, in two,v
from Top to Bottom‚ as neatly as you can : If the
whole Process has been well performed, you will find
a Solid, perfectly yerw, ancl malleable Regulus, ad-
hering to the Bottorn of the Veffel, with Scoria's, re-
maining atop of a brown Colour, solid, hard,and shin-
ing, from which the Regulus must be separated with
several gentle Blows of a Hammer ς this done,
weigh it, after having wiped off all FilthinesS.

4. A sofr, dusty, and very black Scoria, is aSign
of a Fire not sufficiently strong. Small neat Graius
os Copper reduced, but not precipitated‚ and adher-
ing still to the Scoria’s, especially not very far from
the Bottom 3 and an· unequal and ramificated Regulus,
are Signs of the same Thing. A solid, hard, rhin-
ing, red-coloured Scoria‚ especially about the Regu*
lus, or even the Regulus itself when covered with a
like small Crust, are Signs of an Excess in the De·
gree and Duration of the Fire.

The [Ψ and Reasons (gf the Proccfir.

1. You may consult what has been said in
Proc. XXX. Uſs ΝΟ. 1, 2. But all the Ores which
are easily melted in the Fire, are'not the Objects of
this Process ; for they must also be very pure. Such
are the vitreous copper-Ores, but especially the green
and azure coloured-ones, and the caeruleum δέ viride
Montanum (Part I. § 363—366.) wh1ch is not very
different from thern. But if there is a great Qan-
tity of Sulphur, Arsenick, or of the Ore of another
Metal or serni-Metal joined to the Ore of Copper,
then you will never obtain amalleable Regulus of pure
Copper·‚ though Ores are not always rendered re·
fraftory by the presence of these⁴
