7³0 The ΛΒΤ of

put small burning Coals round the Vessel, as it stands
upon the Pavement of the Hearth. Let the Heat
you apply be not greater than what is required to ’
melt the Sulphur ; and continue it such for several
Hours, that is, according as the Qantity of Sul-
phur is great, and the Veffel wide : All which Things
must be determined from Experience. You rnay
also try whether the Sulphur is melted‚ and how
much of it remains3 by boring a small Hole in the
Top of the Alimbeck, or in the Bottom of the uppet-
Veffel‚ not exceeding the Size of a Pea, through
which you may introduce an iron-Wire‚ to the very
Bottom of the Velsel that contains the Sulphur.
However, take as much Care as poffibly you can,
not to. blow any Air in with your Mouth‚ through
the Tobacco-pipe, if you make this Trial with one:
For if the F ire is a little too strong, the Surface of
the melted Sul phurimmediately takes F lame, and by
this Means the Vapours of it moving upwards, break
the Veffels asunder with great Noise‚ and with some
Danger to those that stand by. If the greatest Part
of the Sulphur is sublimed‚ remove the Fire, and
when the Veffels are cooled a little and then opened‚
you will find in the upper-one‚ and in the Brink of
the inferior, light, soft Flowers of Sulphur, of a fine
yellow Colour, having the Characteristicks of per·
fest mineral Sulphur, and made perfeftly pure by
Sublimation. There remains at the Bottom the im-
pure Sulphur, which must be taken out of the Pot
still warm3 because it adheres strongly to it, when
grown cold.

out of the pyritose Ore, being agitated by a strong
F ire, carries some Copper and Iron away with it:
