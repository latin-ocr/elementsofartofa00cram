318 The ΛΒΤ of

APPARATUS.

1. Separate a Specimen of your black Copper‘ of
the Weight of two small docimastical Centners at

¹least3 and doit in the same Manner, and with the
same Precautions, as if you would dete& a Qantity
of Silver in black Copper (Proc. XII. ΝΟ. 1, 2.)

2. Then with Lute and Coal-dust make a Bed in
the Cavity of a Test moistened: When this Bed is
dry put it under the Muffle of the docimastical Fur-
nace, in the open Orifice of which there must be
bright burning Coals‚ wherewith the Test must like-
wise be surrounded on all Parts: When the Whole is
perfestly red-hot, put your Copper into the Fire,
alone, if it contains Lead, but if itis altogether desti-
tute of it, add a small Qantity of Glass ofLead, ancl
with a Pair of Hand-bellom, increase the Fire, that
the Whole may melt with all Speed: This done, let
the Fire be made a little less violent, and such as
will suffice to keep the metallick Mass well melred,
and not much Greater. The melted Mass will
boil, and Scoria’s will be produced that will gaz·
ther at the Circumference. All the heterogeneous
Matters being at last partly diffipatecl‚ and partly
turned to Scoria's, the Sui-face of the pure melrvd
Copper will appear: So soon as you see it, take the
Pot out of the Fire, and extinguish it in Water:
Then examine it in a Balance, and ifLead has been
at first mixt with your black Copper, add to the
Regulus remaining of the pure Copper, one fifteenth
Part of its Weight, which the Copper has lost by
Means of the Lead: Then break it with aVice,
and thus you will be able to judge by its Colour
and Malleability, and by the Surface of it after it
is broken, whether the purifying of it has been well
performed, or no. But, whatever Caution you may
use in the performing of this ProcesS‚ the Produft
will, nevertheless, be always less in Proportion tlgan
