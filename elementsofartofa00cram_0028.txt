12 The ΛΒΤ of

Many kinds of these Stones, which feel like Soap
before they are burm, become somewhat rough 'oy the
F orce of F ire.

32. There are still many other kinds of Stones,
whose Differences are infinite as to their Figure, Co-
lour, Hardness‚ Transparency, and Weight. Ishall
forbear to enumerate them; my chief Purpose requi-
ring, that 1 should only describe here the most com-
mon of them, and those in which the other Minerals
most commonly lye hidden. Belides, there are many
Sorts of Stones that are Mixtures of several other3‚
which it is not our Business here to mention, as we treat

, an infinite Combination of Forms and Proportions in
the Mixture of Stones among themselveS‚ that no Eyc

and other the like outward Qalities‚ are seldom con-
stant, as they depend upon a Multitude of Cause3‚ not
belonging to the Matter ofthe Stone itself: So that he
may easily be deceived, who forms any Judgment or
Distinftion from them. That Method is better

34. Who can deny that there are many Genus‘s and
Species of simple Minerals, besides those already
mentioned? It is not to be doubted, but that there
are in the Nature of Things, Salts, and perhaps Mle-
