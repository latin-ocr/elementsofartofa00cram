The purisying of Silver in a large Tcst, under the

Muffel.

APPARATUS.

1. UT the Test inclosed in an iron-Ring (Part 1.

P Plat. I. Fig. VIII), into the Furnace repre-
sented (Part 1. Plat. IV), as you may very well un-
derstand, from the several F igures of the Furnace‚
and from the Descriptions given of them. When
the Test has been red-hot in a strong F ire for about
half an Hour ς put into it the Silver wrapt up in Bits
of Cloth or of Paper, and divided into several Por-
tions : Fill the Orifice of the F urnace with red burn-
ing Coals, which must be kindled with a Pair of hand·
Bellows‚ till the Silver is in F ufion.

2. This done add some Lead 3 diminifh the Fire a
little: And do the Rest as has been prescribed in the

foregoing Process.
The Use and Reasons of the Process.

1. The purifying of Silver is made in a much
neater Mamer, by this Method than by the forego-
ing 2 And as the Regimen of the Fire may. be observed
here with great Exadffiness, so the Silver is purified
with a less confiderable Loss: For which Reason it
is always preferred to the foregoffig, when you are to
purify Silver mixt with a great Deal of Copper ε But
it is a very long Operation.

2. When you are to purify only a few Ounces, or
one fingle Mark of Silver ς you may put such a small
Apparatus into the docimastical (Part 1. Plat. 1112,

th. 1.) F urnace.
