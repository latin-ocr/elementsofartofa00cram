AssAY1NG METALS. 225

low, sulphureous Pyrites,which harh been thoroughly
proved to be destitute of Silver ς ifit is ground to-
gether with an equal Weight of Filings of Iron3 and
exposed to the Fire‚ in the same Manner as was said
about Sulphur. The Sulphur‚ however fixt in the
PyriteS, requires a great Fire to be expelled ; and by
Means of that Heat penetrates and dissolves the Body
of the Iron at the fiune Time, till at last the Fire be·
ing made still greater, it is intirely diffipated. But
this Method has the Incoriveniency, that the Mass of
the destroyed Iron is greatly increased‚ aud rendered
more refra&ory by the unmetallick Earth of the Py-
rites : Wherefore the prescribed Qiantity of Lead, is
not sufficient in this Case 3 and twelve Centners must
be added to each Part.

2. Crude Antimony is the most potent Menstrztmn
oflron, partly ou Account of its reguline Substmoe,
and partly because of the mineral Sulphur that con-
stitutes about one quarter Partof it. Therefore, a
double Quantiry of it, mixt With Filings of Iron,
dissolves them soon, in a middling melting Fire ; but
then at the same Time the Iron absorbs the Sulphur
ofthe Autimony (Part I. ἓ 147. Coroll. 3), and to-
gether hinders the Sulphur from getting into the Sil-
ver·‚ because Iron is a greater Frieud to Sulphur
(ibid. Coroll 1) .· Therefore, Silver with one Part.
of Regulus of Antimony (which both dissolve each
other aliloe) siuks to the Bottom ·‚ and it is, as ic
were, walhed eleari ol the Iron (Paul. §467.) by
the said reguliue Part. But, that this precipitation
may succeed perfeftly, a pretty strong Fire is re-
quired, aud must be continued for some Time ·‚ and it:
would not be amiss, if a little of t'ue Iron should se-
parate and turn into a Regulus. Nor must the Regel-
lns be poured out into an iton-Cone, but must be left
in the Crucible, and be taken out of it, by breaking
it when grown cold: For so small a Qiautity of
Scoria, being too soon cooled‚ would easily retain
something of the reguline Part together with [be Si}-
Ver. Therefore, this Regmas must be previoussy
