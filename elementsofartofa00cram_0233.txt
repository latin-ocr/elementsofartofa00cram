ASSAYING METAts. 207

together with the Scoria swim'ming upon-it, into a
Funnel (ibid. § 224, 225.) made hot, and rubbed
with Tallow. Thus will the first Operation of the
Process be performed, which does not commonly in-
deed last above three Qarters of an Hour.

5. With a Hammer‚ strike the Scoria’s off from
the Regulus grown cold, and again examine whether
they have the Charaeteristicks (ΝΟ. 4.) of a perfeci:
Scorification: If they have, you may thence con-
clude, that the Silver has been precipitated out of
the Ore turned to Scoria's, and received by the
Lead.

When the Scorification lasts longer than (ΝΟ. 4.)
we mentioned, the Lead at last turns to Scoria's, or
Litharge, and the Silver remains collected at the
Bottom of the Veffel : But the Fire must be mode-
rately supplied, and the Veffels be extremely good,
to produce this Effe& ς for they seldorn refist to the
Strength of the Scoria's of Lead long enough, so as
that the whole Scorification of the Lead may be
brought to an End : Which has afterwards this In-
conveniency that the Silver is diffipated by Grains in
the small Hollows of the corroded Ore, and can hardly
be well collected again, when the Ore has but little
Silver in it : Nay, there is still more Time to be
consumed‚ to obtain the perfect DestruFtion of the
Lead, by Means ofthe combined Aetions of the Fire
and Air, because the Scoria's swimming atop retard
it confiderably.

The Usse and Reasbnssff the Process.

, 1. The State of the filver-Ore depends upon the
Presence of Sulphur and Arsenick : Both these, when
they are not very strongly inherent to the Silver, and
when the Ore is broken small, and extended widely
in a small Quanffly, are in Part eafily diffipated by
the Frre, and in Part absorberi by the Lead (Part I.
§76, 174. Corall. 2.) the lighter Part of which swim-
ming upon the htavier‚ becomes very clammy by
