ASSAYING METALS. 257

The Use and Reastms of the Process.

1. As Mercury requires a Fire three Times strong-
er‚ to be volatilized‚ than &Vater does 3 so when it
is resolved into Fumes, it coagulates immediately, if
touched by Water; nor are you to apprehend lest
the least Qantity of it should evaporate in open Ves-
sels, provided the Orifice of the distillatory Veffel is
inimersed under the Water. You are only to take
Care not to immerse it too deep: For in this Case,
not only the Neck of the Retort splits eafily, but,
when the Degree of the Fire is very great at first,
‚and afterwards les5‚ the Water ascends through the
Neck of the Retort‚ and falls into the Belly of it,
which, on this Account, splits when it is hot·‚ and thus
'the Operation is destroyed. But when the Neck of
the Retort is not immersed, the Joints must in this
Case be closed with Lute: But if you imploy then
too great a Fire, the Vessels burst violently asunder‚
with some Danger‚ because of the pernicious Fume.
Belides, when your Fire is too strong, Part of the
Silvcr easily gers into the Recipient together with the
Mercur .

2. Issy for VVant of an Apparatus for Scorification
and Coppelling, you have a Mind to indicate by this
Method, the Qantity ofSilver contained in the Body
walhed 3 in this Case, the whole Amalgama must be
distilled through the Retort ·‚ because Part of the Sil-
ver and Gold gets through the Leather: Nay, there
remains nothing at all of the Silver or Gold within
the Leather, if you use too greata Qantity of Mer-
cury, to extra& a small Quantity of these Metals:
Unless the Mercury be saturated with them, by a like
previous P1·ocess; and even then, you may be easily

dwiceixied as to the Qantity and Qality of the
, eta. ’
