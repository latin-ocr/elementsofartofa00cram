Ι Of O R E s in general.

331. When Metals and Semi-metals are penetrated
with Sulphur and Arsenick, they always lose, either
that universal Character which is common to all Me-
tals and Semi-metals, or that which is peculiar
(ᾗ 517.) to them alone. Lead and Tin, confounded
with sulphur, not only lose that Charaeter which is
common to all Metals, viz. their Malleability, but
are also deprived of the Properties peculial· to thern,
that is, when in a certain Situation in the Fire: for
⁴ then, they both require a much greater Fire to be
melred, than they would, if they had been free from
Sulphur, and lose besides their Colour. The purest
granulated Silver, confounded with Sulphur, retains
its Malleability, Fufibility, and the other Properties
that are common to all Metals ·‚ but it loses those that
are peculim· to itself: for its most white Colour
changes into that ofLead 3 its hard Consistence turns
into the Softness of the same Metal ; and finally,
when it is but a little heated in the Fire, it then, if
pure before the Fufion, melts so soon as it grows red.
But metallick Bodies are most commonly in that
State naturally, except Gold alone.

332. Natural Concretes, of Metal or Semi-metal,
mixt with Sulphur orArsenick, or with both together,
are called Ores. But when such Alliances are made
by Art, we then say that the Metals or Semi-metals
are reduced to the State of Ores.

333. As, therefore ithas been found hitherto, that
the Causes of this particular strange Form (§33 1.) given
. to metallick or semi-metallick Bodies, refide in the
Sulphur and Arsenick incorporated with their Sub-
stances 3 it would seem to be an easy Matter, to imi-
