‘she Separation of Arsenick out of its Ore, by Sublimation.

APPARATUS.

1. O every Thing as was said about Sulphur
D and Mercury: But let the Veffel which is

should be filled with Waoer, so it be but well luted.
The Fire must likewise beqstronger, and continued
longer, than for the extrasting of Sulphur. Never-
theless‚ every Kind of Arsenick cannot be extracted
in a confined Fire: For, it adheres to the Matrix more
strongly than Sulphur and Mercury. You will find
in the Part of the Veffel which is more remote from
the Fire‚ pulverulent and subtile Flowers ofArsenick,
but there will adhere to the posterior Part of the Neck
of the Retort‚ small solid Maffes, shining like small
CrystaIS, transparent, sometimes gathered into a so-
lid Sublimate‚ and perfeffly white, if the Ore of the
Arsenick was perfeffly pure : Which nevertheless
happens very seldom. The Flowers are most com-
monly thiu, and of a grey Colour 3 which proceeds
from the Phlogiston mixt with the Mass·‚ they are
often of a citron or a golden Colour ·, which is a
Sign that there is in the Mixture some of that mine-
ral Sul phur,which commonly proceeds from the white
Pyrites, with which something of the yellow sulphure-
ous Pyrites is almost always intermixt. But it will
be a Sign of a confiderable Mixture of Sulphur, if
you see the red or yellow melted Subiimate, of which
we have already spoken (Proc. LXVII). Whipe off
the whole very cle-ans then colle&- and weigh it.
