out of it, that it is fruitful in this Meta13 as there
a e very few Ores, that are not sometimes contigu-
ous to yfi-lver Ores. But if such a Concretion has
been made by minute Marses, you cannot eafily per-
ceive at first Sight, whether 1t is proper to the Ore,
or only? Λ,6616160111 Hence the Reason may be un-
derstood, why Regz‘lzts’s precipitated separately and
at diffe rent TimeS, out ofimpure Bits of Ore, when
tri ’,661 do not yield at every Ἰ rme the same Qantity
of Silver, in proportior} to that of the Metal,
thorbi h no Error s aie committed 111 the Operation:
which never happenS, when the Ore is well beaten
and mixt before, or when you use it perfeffly

p 393 The pute (ᾗ 384—388. ) proper Ores of Sil-
ver, either [11016 [1116 are ἰ11601ρο111661 with some pure
copper or lead· Ores, or t‘hose that are only inter-
mixed with tl·,1ern a e of themselves fufible. Now,
what Ores are 16111161οὟ aud not fufible, may be un-
derstood from what was said before (ᾗ 334), as it
holds equally true of all kinds of Ores. But the tin-
Ore requires here a particular Consideration : for, in
the Fire, it is refraclory neither alone, nor joined to
other Ores : my, Tin may be very easily mixt with
Silver, but above all with Lead (ξ 41 and 57): How-
ever, it sometimes happens, that, as soon as you in-
create the Fue, so as that the Lead maye, orow red,
the Tin separares from it (ξω.) in form of Calx3
which Calx is altogether indiffoluble by Lezd and
with great Difficulty diffolved by the Glass of it,
and takes away a great Qantity ofl tl 16 Silver, when
this has been mixt before with Tin. But Silver is, by*
Lead, washed off with a strong Fire, from all he·
terogeneous Metal, Gold excepted. XNhence it is
plain? that Silver and its Ore, when Tin or its Ore
is m ixt to it, must be looked upon as refraGkory,

and for what Reason.
