white, sometimes grey, yellow‚ or of other ColourS,
belonoincr to the Bodies mixt with it.

31?- Xothenever Sulphur is titietured with a dark,
or bright Orange or red Colour‚ this always betrays
Arsenick in it: Wherefooe, Sulphurs thus coloured are
not true, nor very valuable. Ι

316. The most frequent and almost the proper Mi-
neral of Sulphur is the Pyrites flavus, or yellow Py-
rites. This, when free of all heterogeneous Matters
at the ouffide, and bright, has all the Appearanee of
poliffled Brass‚ and is more various as to its Form,
than any other Mineral: however it is most com-
monly found of a globulous Form, then of a cubi-
cal, hexagonal‚ both regular and irregular Figure.
It is solid ·‚ unless it be rendered sofr by a Mixture of
soft Stones and Earths : whe'n struck with a Steel‚ it
gives sparks like a Flint : when brought near a gen-
tle Fire, it soon bursts, with a crackling Noise3 and
emits small Flames almost sulphureous : it changes its
yellow Colour into a dark red, and its neat Surface
into adusty one. It is very rich in Sulphur, and con-
tains one quarter, sometimes almost one third Part
of it. Moreover, there is always a Qantity of Iron
lurking in it ·‚ its sulphureous Part is sometimes great-
er, sometimes less : and Henckel has found that it also
contains a kind of Earll.) not metallick, and in a va-
rious Proporrion as to the other Parts ε which makes
us easily guess, that the specifick VVeight of the Py-
rites must be very various, The Authorjust menti-
oned, has, in his Treatise on Pyrites *‚ given us a
very ample History of this Mineral, together with a
very accurate Analyfis of it.

317. There are very few Minerals altogether de-
stitute of Sulphur: but as the extrasting of it would
never pay the Charges, and they besides contain Me-
tals and Semi-Metals in a greater Qantity ·, for this
