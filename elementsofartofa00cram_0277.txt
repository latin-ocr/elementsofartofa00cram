AssAY1NG ME‘TAL'S. 251

2. Shut the Crucible very close : Increase the F ire
still more 3 and after having left it so for about half
aQarter of an Hour 3 pour the Mass out into a
melting Cone, rubbed with Tallow, and warmed,
or into an iron-Mortar, prepared after the same
Manner.

3, When it is grown colel, shake the Matter out ε
You will find at Top Scoria’s to be taken off, and
at Bottom a Regulus, that will have all the Silver in
it, together with the Lead, or at least with Part of
it. The Regulus may be Coppelled in a Test.

4. If you know that there is already the same Qan-
tity of Lead in the Minore, it is not neceffary to add
any granulated Lead ς but rather to double the
WVeight of the ison-Filings.

, The Use and Reasons of the Proust.

1. All that was said (Part Ι, § 147. Coroll. 1, 4.)
is very well and plain. But you must add Lead to-
wards the End 3 that the Silver which is perhaps still
inherent in the Mixture, being quicker diffolved by
the Lead, may be precipitated‚ and sink to the Bot—
torn ς or that the Sulphur may be intirely taken away
by the Lead (l. c), isit has not been thoroughly de-
stroyed by the Iron. There are also some other Me-
tals‚ that have the same Effe& ; but Lead is chosen
in this Case‚ because it is very conveniently separated
a second Time fron] the Silver : For there is always
something o'fthe precipitating Metal, that mixes with
the Metal to be precipitated3 the more so, as the Se-
paration is more exaffly done : For who can so exaffly
determine the Point of Saturation, and the Degree of
the Fire ?

2. You must not use Filings quite spoiled with
Rust: For they have no Virtue for absorbing the
Sulphur.

3. The CrucibleS, which have served to these Pro-
ceffis, retain a little of the Silver, especially if they
are rough at the Inside : For this Reason, the same
Crucible‚ so long as it remains imit-e, must alyvays
