Of A L L o M, and the Minerczls out of which it is
extraffled.

424. Allom (O) is a Salt of a white or a light
reddifh Colour, and ofa sweet styptick Taste. When
diffolved in Water, and duly inspiffated and grown
colel, it forms semi-transparent ostoedral CrystaIS,
which first mest, boil, and foam in the Fire, and
emit Phlegm in great plenty, and then turn into a
light, spungy, and very white Mass: But the Fire
being increased‚ they at last give the same aeid Spirit
as Vitriol (§ 417), or burning Sulphur (ᾗ 312.) do,
there remaining a light kind of white Earth, nearly
of the Nature of (ᾗ 31, 2.) Marl.

425. Allom (§ 424.) is produced, either out of a
black‚ mining, bituminous Mineral, easy to be cleft,
hence of the Nature of (ᾗ 319.) Sea-Coals, very uni-
form, but light, sometimes librom, and resembling
Wood ε or out of a soft bituminous Lump. These
Lumps are inflammable, and, when gathered· into
Hmps, they ofthemselves grow hot, and take Fire‚
sending forth mean while a loetid, bituminous, strong
Odoin, and leaving after they are burnt a kind of
spongy Barth, that has a little Taste. But'when they
do not take Fire, but only grow warm, and cleave ·‚
then they become very fruitful of Allom ε therefore,
you must prevent their taking Fire, by pouring a
little Water upon thern ·‚ because their happening to
be inflamed renders the Masscs unfruitful.

426. But the other Minerals out of which Allom
is produced, are not bstuminmm, nor of Course in-
flammahle. To this Class belong some Concretes‚
resembling common Clay, that eleave easily, as like-
wise the Calamine mentioned (ᾗ 412). However the
latter, as well as the foregoing (ᾗ 425.) bitummous
Specie8‚ requires to be gently roasted previously in an
open Fire, to produce Allom. I
