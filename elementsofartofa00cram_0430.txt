1. Copper and Iron rende r the Precipitation of the
Regulus of Arsenick abundant and easy 1n this Pro-
cess, but they do 1t from another Cause than in the
Produc‘tion of the Regulus of Antimony. For 1n the
latter they were added, that the mineral Sulphur

which retained the reguline Part diffolved in crude
Antimony., n¹ ight be absorbed by the1n3 which done,
the Regulzs rendered free went to the Bottom‚ while
the Metal that was in the Mixtme charged with Sul-
phur, swam a-top in Forn] of Scoria's. But, in
this Operation‚ Arsenick which is of itselfaltogcther
volatile, must be exposed to a very violent Fire sud-
denly applied, that it may be fixt with these Metals‚
after having been reduced to a serni-metallick and
very volatile Regulus. Whence it is likewise self-evident,
that the Regulus of it participates very much of any
precipitatingMetal whatever, and is less uncornpounded ⁹
than the Regulus ofAntimony precipitated by Metals‚
and that of Course it cannot be purified again by
way of Fufion : For, it is presently resolved into
FumeS, as soon as it is separated from the Metal
that fixes it, ,

Qantity of it is sublimed‚ the semi· metallick arse·
nical Part, is for the greatest Part carried up, and
must be looked upon as the purest reguline Substance
of Arsenick: For, there remains at the Bottom of the
Cucurbite‚ that Metal by which the Regulus has been
precipitated3 but, it is tainted with a great Deal of
Arsenick: Nor can it be diffipated otherwise than by
repeating the Roasting and the Pulverismg, in an
open Fire increased by Degrees. See particularly
