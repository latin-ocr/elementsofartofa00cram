is required with Regard to this refiduous Copper,
than is necessary, even in the Lead itself, with Re-
gard to the Copper mixt to it. He therefore who
attempts the most intimate Depuration of Silver by
coppelling, must previoussy render the Lead per-
feffly pure from all Copper: of which hereafter.

1. Onnd one Centner of the Ore 3 roast it (Proc.

IV. ΝΟ. Ι.)·, when roasted, beat it to a most
subtil Powder ς and, if it melts with Difficulty on
the Fire‚ grind it together with one Centner of Li-
tharge, which is not necessary, when the Ore melts
eafily. Then divide the Mixture, or the Powder of
the Ore alone, into five 01· six Parte, and wrap up
every one of them severally, in such Bits of Paper as
can contain no more than this small Portion.

2. Put a very large Coppel under the Muffel :
Roast it well first, and then put into it sixteen Cent-
ners oi Lead ε WVhen the Lead begins to smoak and
boii, put upon it one of the said (N‘', ι.) Portions
with the small Paper it was wrapt up in, and dimi-
niss1 the Fire immediately, in the same Manner as if
yon would make a Scorification in a Test, bnt in a
lesser Space of Time. The small Paper, which turns -
presently to Afhes, goes off of itself, and does not
senfibly increase the Mass of the Scoria’s: The Ore
proceeding therefrom, is cast on the Bomier, and turns
to Scoria's very soon. Increase the Fire again imme-
diately, and at the same Time put another Portion
of the Ore into the, CoppeI, as was just now said ε
The same Effefts will be produced. Go on in the
same Manner, till all the Portions are thrown in,
and consumed in the Lead. Finally, destroy the re-

maining Lead with a stronger Fire. Ι
