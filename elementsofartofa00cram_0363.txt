strongly. Let the Coals be small, and ofa soft
Woo‹1‚‘ that a pretty strong Fire may be most quickly
kindled‚ and extinguished soon. For, ifsmall Coals
are agitated with Bellows‚ they grow red-hot, and are
consumed much sooner than the large ones·‚ and if
you sprinkle them here and there with Water drop
by drop with ¹a small Broom, the Fire grows of the
utmost Strength: For which Purpose, likewise, you
may put moistened Ore into the F ire.

Earth and the Iron-ore may be known by the

is plain from what follows, that this Examination is
upon no Account sufficient. For, all Metals, semi-
Metals, Squhur, and Arsmick, except only Anti-
mony and Lead (which last is not to be considered,
because it never admits of any Mixture of Iron) be'-
ing united in great Qiantity with Iron by Fire,

(Vid. Cl. Henckeliz' pyritolog. pag. 413). And though
the Action of the Load-stone is the weaker upon
Iron, as there is a greater Qantity of the Minerals
just mentioned joined with it, and vice versa ·‚ never-
theless, we can upon no Account conclude from the
strong or weak Aetion of the Magnet‚ what
Qantity of Iron can be reduced out of the Ore, or
out of any other martial Compound : Because
the various Strength of Lozid—stones‚ and the Qality
and Proportion of the several Bodies that may be
combined with Iron, occafions a very great Diffe-
