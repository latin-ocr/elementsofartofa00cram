ASSAYING‘METALS. 61¹

whether it can restst Fire‚ and the Glass ofLead: For
you cannot 'determine the exa& Proportion of the
Ingredient3‚ on Account of the Variety of Clays.
Nature now and then affords in some Places Clay so
well tempered, that it is extremely proper for the
making of Telis, without any Preparation, or with·
out a Mixture of another Mamer: Sometimes it on·-
ly wants to be washed ε But most commonly it must
be first prepared in the abovementioned (§188.>
Manner.

190. If then the Mass under Trial (ᾗ 189.) turns
into Glas53 you must add to it some of the aforesaid
Dusts of Stones, especially of incombustible Stones.
However, take care not to add too much of pulver-
ized Chall<3 for if the Matter is tempered with
that alone, the Tests made with it, will indeed re-
fist Fire the rnore·, but being too porous by this
means, they yield a Paffage to Litharge3 which
being absorberi, they sosten to such a Degree, that
they fall asunder of themselves, or are totally
crushed when you take hold of them with TongS.

191. Tests are made in Moulds (Plat. 1. Fz'g. V.
and VI.) after the following Manner. Rub a little
Mortar and the Pestle lightly with Bacon or Oil·,
then fill first the two thirds of it with prepared Clay
(§ 188.) and then with your Thumb make a small
Pit in the middle of. the Clay3 put the Pestle upon
it, and press the Matter with Blows of a Hammer⁹
the stronger the better3 and finally take the Test
out of the Ring‚ in the Manner mentioned (§ 178.
N. 4.) as was said of CoppelS.

192. The clayy Matter here to be used, must be
so stiff and dry, that it may break the Moment you
bend it with your Hands: For if it is too sofr, it
will hardly be poffible to have any intire Tests, or
at least they are milhapen. Nor yet must the Clay
be over dry3 otherwise it would be difficult to
falhion.
