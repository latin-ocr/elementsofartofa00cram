Cementation ff. But the Graim, after each Cemen-
tation‚ must be separated from the Cementab by
washin .

4 12}st rnuch greater uantity os other Metals is
mixt with the Gold, it is not proper to separate
the n by a Cementttion ·, but m this Cise, the Cop-
pel and Pxecipitation by Fufion (Part Ι. § 466.) must
be iffleferied.

ἔ. As tl e Cei-nent recen es the Silver that was in
the Gold, this may bc reduced together with other
the like Sweepings mixt with Gold and Silver. For
this Purposc‚ t'nose Things are melted at leastwith
lead-Ore or Lifflarge, and with the other Drosses of
Lcad, in the Manner described (Part l. ᾗ 240.)
All the Silver and Gold is then received by the Lead,
stom which these precious Metals may afterwards be
separated by the Coppel.

6. There are other Cements besides these, which
are called gmdcztory ς because they give Gold, though
already perfeffly pure, a much deeper yellow Colour
than it naturally has. But Copper, or at least the
Bodies proceeding froin it, and not yet intirely de-
stroyed, enter into all these CementS. For Instance‚
the Filings of Copper are calcined with Sulphur‚ and
the Crocus proceeding therefrorn‚ serves instead of

' Cernent, either alone, or mixt with the common

Ingredients of Cement83 and the Gold cemented
with it during twenty Hours is thereby rendered
1n·oie yellow. The blue Vitriol has the same Virtue.
But V erdigrease has it chiefly 3 and these Cements
’ are commonly sprinkled with the Solution of Salt
ArnmoniaC, and with V inegar But the Colour
they,t> cive proceeds from the Copper which joins with
the Gold·, w herefore it is again diffipated by Lead,
Andrnony, and the ordinary& Cements. Therefore,
these Kinds of Cemenm, it seems, ought to be called
degradatmy, rather than' gradatory, because they in
Reality render Gold impure.
