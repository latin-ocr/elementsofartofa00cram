different from Borax, and on this Account ought not
by any Means to be confounded with it. But the
vulgar Borax we buy, which they call (refined)
when purified, appears to be in every Respeet adul-
terated. Thac which is crude and called fat Bomx,
or Tincal, and is brought us from the East, especi-
ally the East—Ilzdz'es, is certainly very different from
that which is called refinecl Borax. But we know
not yet, what additional Ingredients they make Use
of for the purifying, or rather the adulterating of it :
for they look upon it as a Secret. Nor do the Puri-
fyers of Borax willingly admit any Body into their
LaboratorieS, which are chiefly at Amsterdam and
Venice.

*Borax or Tincal (ξ 434) : It consists of prismatical‚
hexa'e'dral‚ nitrous Crystals, truncated on every Side,
and sufficiently thick 3 neverthelesS, not so long or
regular, as are the nstrous, nor so closely joined, as
is seen in other Salts, but more simple and solitary‚
of a bluish Colour, pretty hard, ponderOUS‚ very dif-

easily melting in the Fire, and not so apt to rise into
a Fmrn, as that called refined Borax.

436. We have not hitherto heard any certain Re-
lation‚ concerning the Manner in which Bor-ax is
primitively obtained ·‚ whether it is found native in
the Barth, such as it was described (§ 435)·, or wash-
ed out of a certain Matrix, like Nitre'‚ and then by
Crystallisation reduced to the already-mentioned Fi-
gure: which indeed appears to be more probable
than the former.
