ly, According to the several wez'ght of the Atmosphere it-
self: Though the Effeci* of its Variations be not very const-
derahle. ‘This accounts why there are as many different
specifick Gravities affigned to Metals‚ as there are Au-
thors that have fharched this Matter by Experiments.
However, unleſs the Metals be of a very great Irnpurity‚
the Sum cf all the Dg'fflfrences mysiilting from the said
Causa, is not fiffcient to hinder any particular Metal to
be di inguifhed from any other by its specifick Wm'ght.

13. These agree with the foregoing‚ except that
they have not near the sanie *Malleabilitffi if even they
have any. They are as fol-lowff

14. Zfflk, is a Body of a blueiffiwhite Colour3
brittle and somewhat tenacions ·‚ ofconsequence some-
what malleable, though much less than Metals. It
melts in a gentle Fire, soon after it smoaks, and then
stioks to *the Furnace in ‘the Form of exceeding light
white Flowers. In a greater Fire it burns with a
Flanae of the most beautiful green Colour, which evi-
dently betrays an Abundance of Sulphur.

15. Bi'finuth, YiJz-Glaffi when broken, appears to
confist of small cubic Particles, and these again confist
of minute aninn’s applied to each other. It is more
brittle than the foregoing, but differs little externa!-
ly, except that itdoes not assume thehlue Colonr, but
looks rather ofa ffiining and very light yellow.

16. Regulus ofAntimonv, is extremely brittle. When
perteffly cleansed from Sulphur‚ it stirpaffes the tore-
'going in whiteness: It requires a greater Fire to be
melted ς which renders iteasy to be distinguished from
the two former.

17. There is among the Minerals‚ another Body,
which deserves to be classed among the Semi-Metals,
