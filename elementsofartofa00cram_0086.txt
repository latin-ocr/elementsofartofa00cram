215. Finally‚ you must have for the Granulation
of Lead and Tin above described (§ 44.) a granulat-
ing wooden Box, with its Cover‚ and so large as
that some Pounds of Metal may be contained and
well shaken in it. You have the Figure of it (Plat.
ΙΙ. Fzg. XVII).

216. But to granulate Metals the wet VVay, you
may use any Veffe1‚ if it be but wide, filled with cold
Water‚ which must be stirred about with a Broorn.
For Instance, the Metal, when a good Qantity of
it is to be reduced into Grains at once, is first melted ;
then with a very small red hot Crucible‚ held with
a Pair of Tongs, it is laded up out of the larger
Veffel wherein is the whole melted Mass, and while
another Man stirs the Water about with the Broom,
which he then raises one half above the Water, you
pour it ai] at once upon the said Broom‚ that it may fall
through it into the Water. But the Sprigs of the
Broom must not be too close, lest the Metal being
stopped by so many Obstacles, should wax cold too
soon, and by being detained between their Interstices‚
adhere to them, and not reach the Water. When
all the Metal has been thus injeRed, and the Water
decanted, you will find it divided into small Par-
tides.

217. Some use a particular Machine‚·rnade on pur-
pose for this Vv⁷ork‚ and represented (Plat. XI. Fth.
XVIII). They take a wooden Cylinder, fix Inches
long, and ten in Diameter‚ and adapt to it an Axis
and Handle, like a Grindstone. Then cut all round
longitudinally fix or eight Channels about three In-
c'nes deep. Then put the Cylinder thus prepared
upon aTub οι· wideVessel, like that described (§ 2 16) ·‚
so that the Axis of it being received by Semi-circular
Cavities cut in the Border of the Veffel‚ may be kept
steddy, lest it should fly out of its Place in the Ro-
tation. Then the Veffel is filled with WVater to such
an Height, as that one third Part of the Cylinder
may be immersed in the VJater3 then throw the
melted Meta), laded up after the Manner mentioned
