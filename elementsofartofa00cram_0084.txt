68 The ART of

For your common Earthen·ware‚ which is generally
glazed with Litharge, grows clammy in the strongest
rire, and sticks to the Vessels; so that they are ta-
ken off with difficulty, or even melt entirely. It is
then better to cut off Pieces like Tiles with a Knife,
fron] a Cal<e of Clay (§ 188.) extended upon a flat
Table, of the Bigness requilite, according to the dif-
ferent Diameters of the Veffels to be closed. Then
pare away the Borders of the inferior Su‘rface of the
Plate so cut off, which is to touch immediately the
Vessel to be closed, leaving a Shoulder all round, by
means of which the Tile is fastened in such a Manner,
that it is not easily removed by the Poker, or when
fresh Coals are put on the Fire. Finally‚ you put
in the Middle of the outfide a small Bit of the sanie
Clay ς that it may be easily taken away or put on the
Veffel again with Tongs, by means of this Kind of
Handle.

209. The small separatory Cucurbites or Matrafles
(Plat. Il. Fzg.X1.) must be made of very transpa-
rent Glass, and yet capable of resisting the most
corrofive Mezfflrzm, lest they should be corroded.
Nor must they be two thick, especially at the Bot-
tom 3 for when they are very thick they easily burst
in the Fire. Let them be eight or ten Inches high,
with a very narrow Orifice, hardly half an Inch
wide3 lest the Matter therein contained, being in a
violent Ebullition, should rise over the Mouth of the
Veffel, or at least Part of it be thrown out in small
Drops, like a thin Rain, to which there is always a
little of the Metal adhering 3 that in short a greater -
Repercuffion of the F umes may be made. The bot-
torn has a sufficient Capacity, when it contains one or
two Ounces of Aqua Fortis. It is belides proper,
that their Orifice be turned backwards into a broad
Margin or Lip‚ lest the Solutions‚ when poured
out, should run down along the Sides of the Veffel.

210. To support such a small Cucurbite, (§ 209.)
we use a Trivet (Plat. II. Fzg. XII.) so made, that
