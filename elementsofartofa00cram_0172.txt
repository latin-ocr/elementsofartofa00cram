(ᾗ 359.) out of the Caput Mortuum of this Ore, some
Iron remaining after the Sublimation made in close
Veffels ; though you use the choicest Bits of the Ore
for this Experiment. However, it has in it the same
Qantity of Silver, as the horny Ore above-menti-
oned (ᾗ 386.)

388. The white filver-Ore‚ of a light grey Co-
lour, of an irregular Figure, pretty ponde-trous, and
’ very brittle, has at the same Time some Copper in
it ; nay, it even contains most commonly more Cop-
per than Silver : so that it differs from the white
copper-Ore (ᾗ 367.) only on account of the Qantity
of Silver it contains. It is heavier than the two fore·

389. We have not hitherto known any besides
these four (ξ 385—388.) filver-Ores, though many
others ate looked upon by some, as such: However,
the Thing being well examined‚ they either are im—
proper to Silver, or prove to be composed of the al-
ready mentioned proper silver-Ores·‚ that is, some-
times of them all, and sometimes of only some of them,
mixt together in many different Proportions. And
this Mixture is sometimes so very subtle, that it can
hardly be perceived with a Microscope. And in-
deed among the iron, copper, lead, and tin- .
Mines, already explained (§ 342—382)‚ you will
sometimes find some, that will yield no inconfiderable
Qantity of Silver ; butas these contain more of the
other Metals, they on this Account must be called
improper silver·Ores‚ when they have any Silver in-
termixed with their Substance (ξ 31 1.) or accidental
silves-Ores, when there is only some Silver adhering
to their Outfide (ξ 31 1.)

390. The white and grey copper-Ores (§367),-
may be called improper filver-Ores, as they are al-
ways impregnated with Silver. But the· other copper-

Ores, though they most commonly contain Silveir·‚
