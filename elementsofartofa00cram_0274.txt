Manner: The Reason of this Diverlity is, that they
do not imploy a Fire sufficiently strong, to consume
or diffipate all Sorts of Nitre.

3. Silver thus purified for the first Time, has al·
ways in it a small Qantity of heterogeneous Metal :
But if you melt it a second Time (N0. 3.) with Ni-
tre, and pour it out the Moment it is in Fufion‚ you
free it of that Refidue‚ and render it very easy to be
bent. But your Silver will not acquire so great a.
Degree of Purity and Pliantness‚ unless you pour it
out the very Instant it is in Fufion. For the Nitre,
when left too long in the Fire‚ diffipates‚ or changes:
And when this happens, the Metals calcined by the
Nitre, though in ever so small a Qantity, are re-
duced by the fat Exhalations of the Coals, and much
more still when the Coals themselves fall into them ε
Nor is the refiduous alkaline Salt an Obstacle, but ra-
ther a Help to this. And as Gold, above all, is ren·
dered very rigid, or even quite brittle, by the least-
Qantity of Tin, Regulus of Antimony‚ &a the
Reason is plain, why unskilful Artificers, try ten
Times and more, to render Gold pliant by Means of
Nitre, before they can obtain it.

PROCESS XV.

Precipitation ff Silver out of the stzme Badies as were
mentioned in the foregoing Proccffes by Scorq‘fication,
iil a C rucible.

APPARATUS.

1. H E Body out of which you intend to preci-
Τ pirate Silver‚ must be previoussy prepared for

a Scorification with its proper Ingredient83 of which
we have already spoken in the foregoing Process 3
then in the same Manner, and with the same Qan-
tity of granulated Lead, put it into a Crucible strictly
examined, that it be intire, solid, not speckled with
‘shelz Spot52 like the Sars-:uria of Iron, especially Ianits
