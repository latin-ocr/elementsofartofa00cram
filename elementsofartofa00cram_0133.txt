which yo'u engrave a Mark, indicating their purity,

290. Let us now ssiew the Manner of making

these Touch-needles (gs 289); and first of al! the
Siiver ones. These must be tempered only with Cop-
per : But the Proportion is determined by the Mari<
(ᾗ 284.) divided into half-Ounces and Grains. There-
fore‚ you must use sor that Purpose one Mark of such
a Weight, as that it may constitute a sufficient Mass
of Metal for the making of one Needle: Let it then
weigh‚ for Instance, one whole Dram. Then weigh
such a Mark of the purest Silver, wrap it in a sniail
Paper, upon which you will write sixteen half
Ounces ς which will signify, that the whole Mark of
this Metal is the purest Silver. Make the first Needle
with this MasS. Next‚ weigh fifteen half Ounces of
pure Silver, and one half Ounce of pure Copper ·‚
wrap thern both together in a Paper, and mark upon
it fifteen Ounoes, which will signify, that there are
in that small Mass fifteen Parts of pure Silver, and
one of pure Copper. Make of this the second Needle.
Then add two half Ounces ofCopper to fourteen half
Ounces of pure Silver ; and marl< it fourteen half
OunceS. Make a third Needle of this, Goon thus,
and proportion the small Maffes of Silver and Copper
for the making of the other Needles‚ and put In·
scriptions upon every one, in the following Manner.
