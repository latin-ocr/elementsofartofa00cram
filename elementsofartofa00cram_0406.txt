OF MINERAL SULPHUR.

PROCESS LXVII.

‘she Distillation of Sulphur out of the Pyrites‚ and other
sulphureous Mnerals.

APPARATUS.

EAT the yellow pyrites, or any other sul·
phureous Mineral‚ to a coarse Powder, put it

into an earthen Retort‚ or into a glass·one coated
with Lute‚ having a long large Neck, and perform
the Distillation in the same Manner as (Proc. LVIII.)
swas prescribed about Mercury. But, you are to ob-
serve‚ that, if this Mineral is so refrastory in the F ire
that it does not grow soft when made middling
red—hot, you may make an Experiment with a greater
Qantity of it exceeding two or three Pounds‚ and
increase the F ire more quickly, and thus perform the
Operation in a shorter Time. Of this Kind is the
yellow martial Pyrites, which is chiefly the Ore out
of which almost all the common mineral Sulphuris
got (Part Ι. §316, 347). But, if it grows soft
when it begins to be red-hot, and the Ore is inclined
to mest, you must put a smaller Qantity of it into
the Retort‚ and manage the F ire more gently, whence
the Distillation lasts a longer Time ε This the Py-
rites of Copper‚ or the yellow Copper-ores (Part 1.
ᾗ 369) do require, as well as the common (Ιςεειά-
