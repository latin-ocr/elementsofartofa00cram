wiſse the same Flowers and Sublimates, though without
the Affistance of Zink : On which Accouizt the said Sub-
limate and Flowers are of various Kinds. However‚
wherever thefi’ are produced, they are always Indications
‘ff some thing (ff the Arsenical or the Semi—metallick Spe-

Leuci, and Tin, change their Form, lose all their
Malleability‚ and part of their Fufibility, by a long
and strong Calcination‚ and of Consequence lose their
metallick (ᾗ 5.) Nature. Semi· Metals‚ Arsenick ex
cepted‚ by a like Calcination, dissolve into Calx‚s
which by a strong Fi1e (ᾗ 8. Sc hol.) tu1n to Scoriae, or
become volatile.

91. If you add to these Calxs (§ 90.) a sulphurous

so fixt of its Nature as not to be diffolvable by any

restored to its Pristim, either Metallick (§5.) or Serni-
metallick State (ξ 13.) 3 which Operation is called
Reduftion.

92. This reduced Metal or Semi-metal, may, by
repeating the Calcination, again be destroyed (ᾗ 90.)
and in the same Manner (§91.)‘be reduced to a like
Scoria‚ or a like Calx,
