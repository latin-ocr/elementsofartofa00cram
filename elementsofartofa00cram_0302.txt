276 The ΛΒΤ of

parate the Regulus from the Antiniony at Top, ac·
cording to ΝΟ. 1 : This you may repeat even a third
Time.

3. Nem, put this Regulus into a thick Test well
conditioned : Place it before the Bellows, according
to Process X, put Coals round it, and one οι· two
Pieces of WVood upon them, and make a middling
Fire, that is, such as is sufficient to melt the Regulus.
The reguline Part of the Antimony will vanish in a
thick Smoak: Towards the End increase the Fire
more and more, and keep it so, till the Fumes are
over, and the Surface of the Gold of a green and neat
Colour. If the Regulus is but in small Qantity,
this Operation may be performed with a Pair of hand-
Bellows. Melt the remaining Gold with Borax and
Nitre, according to Proc. XXI N‘’. 33 that being
freed of the small Qantity of Regulus of Antimony
which may happen to remain, it may be rendered
pliant: Which may be done still better by Cemen-
tation‚ when there is Occafion.

4. But when the Gold is impure to an Allay of
eight Carat33 it is not proper to perform the Preci-
pitation by Antimony alone: But you must add to
the Antirnony as many Times two Carats of common
Sulphur, as the Allay of the Gold is so many Carats
less than eighteen. As for the Rest‚ let the Operation
be made as (ΝΟ. 1). Likewise let the Regulus be
melted twice or thrice more, with crude Anrimony,
and the reguline Part of this, which was joined to
the Gold, be diffipated.

5. The sulphureous Mass swiniming at Top of the
Regulus (Νο. 1, 2, 4), and broken off from it,
contains all the Metal separated fron] the Gold:
Therefore it must be kept, that you may separate
from it the Sssver, together with the small Quan-
tity of Gold which has been carried away by it.
