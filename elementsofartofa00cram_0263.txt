Silver from being spineti, if the Test should at the
same Time contra& a large Crack.

2. If you add the Lead at several Times, the puri-
fyine, of tlie Silver may be performed, with a much
less Qiantity of it, than thar indicated in the eighth
process. However‚ tl‘rongh, in this Operation‚ the
Silver be found pure at Top3 nevertheless, Part of
the Leuci, w'nich is lieavier‚ commonly hides itself
underneath (Pro-c. Π. Uſs N⁰.3), unless the Mass in
fusion be now ancl then stirred with a Piece of Iron,
towards the End. But the same Inconvenience may
be prevented in the small Tests or Coppels, if you
strike these little Veffels with an iron—Wire‚ while
the Silver is still in fufion, that this being melted may
be {li-aken. WVhence it plainly 'appears, that Silver
and Lead mixt only by Firc, are not so well mixt to
each other, as that a perfectly proport‘ionable Qan-
tity of both, may be found in any Part of the Mix-
ture whatever: Which being either unknown to οι·
neglected by Artificers, deceives them very often.

3. By this Memmi, a considerable Qantity of
Silver may be purified at one and the same Time z
But isa very refraftory Scoria is produced, for In-
hince by a Mixtnre οἵ Tin, it must now and then be
sunl< to the Bottorn with a Poker, that the Silver
may bc waslicd off from it : And thus cast on the
Border οἵ the Test. But it is proper afterwards to
examine such a Scoria‚ to see whether it lias not car-
ried away with it, a Qantity ofSilver deserving the
Charges of a Separation.

4. The Lead may again'be reduced ont of the
Tests employed in this Operation3 my, this Lead
is not even without some Silver3 especially if the,
Tests were not good, or the Operations not exaffly
made: But then it will be proper again to use the

farne. Lead for a like Operation ς that the Silver rnay
at last be separated from it.
