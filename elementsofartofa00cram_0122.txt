lance being elevated, you see the Beam moving in the
Fork, not only up and down, but also fide-ways,
this likewise shews a Defest in the Balance. You
must, besides, reckon it one of the Faults of your
Balance, · if, when having lifted it up, and put itin
equilibrw, you lower one of the Scales with your
Finger, and this does not return to its Equipoise,
when the Fino ger is removed: If this be the Case,
your Balance may indeed be right, as to the Length
and VVt-ight of the Arms of the Beam, but it can
hardly be restored to an exact Equipoise, whence it
is less fit to weigh any thing exaffly.

269. But it is·not enough to have known whether Α
a Balance was just or defeftive ε ‘vVe must likewise be “
able to correct the Faults detected in it. You must
then above all know the Causes of the Defefts ·, that,
by removing them, the perfect Exaetness defited may
be obtained. Nay, the Affayer stands in greater
Need of knowing how the Faults of a Balance are
corrected, than the Manner in which the Balance is
made ·‚ because, by mending, he at last obtains the
scrupulous Exaetness requisite in docimastical Ponde-
rations. Let us then take this Point in hand. First,
it is a teasmg Fault in a Balance, when it cannot ei-
ther be reduced to a Situation perfeffly horizontal,
or, when being reduced to it, and either ofits Scales
being lowered, it is not immediately restored to its
first State, by'the Removal of the Power that lowers
it. This shews that the Axis upon which the Beam
of the Balance is supported, is in the same horizontal
Line with those Points to which the Powers are ap-
plied. To correct this, take the Beam out of the
Fork, and with a Pair of Pincers, lower a little the
ringed Extremities ’(ιι b) of the Arms ε, with such
Evenness however, thata Thread extended from one
Ring to the other, along the Length of the Beana,
may be on either Side at right Angles with the Tongue
of the Balance‚ which must be proved by applying to
it a Square 2 But if the Balance put in equilibriO,

does not easily change its situation, with a verxyvsrmssll‘l!Y
