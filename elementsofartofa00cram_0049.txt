ASSAYING METAmts 33

then these Additions are perfefftly needless, and by
over- swelling the Mass to be distillecl‚ requires
Veffels of a much laro oer Size.

116. Nay, therea re befides many other, partly
needless and partly noxious Ingredients, used by Di.
stillers of Aqua Fortis. Such are Blood-stones‚ un-
ssacked Lime, Plumose AHurn, &a all which it is
nevertheless very proper not to use ε For they are so
far from having any good Effe&s‚ that they on the
contrary yield a much worse and more expenfive Aqua
Fortis. This Water therefore must never be used in
docimastical Operations‚ before it has been accurately
tried. For indeed Aqua Fortis is but too often taint-
ed with these heterogeneous Mamers, the major Part
of it consumes away, and it is frequently so sixt, that
the strongest Fire is hardly able to take off the least
Part of it. I would then here have nothing used be-
fides calcined Vitriol‚ intimately mixt with Nitre ;
there being no need of any other.

117. However, Bole, Chry, and sssick-Dust, do
likewise expel Aqua Fortis out of Nitre, which then
is called Spiritus Nitri. Bm: you must add four
Times as much of these, in Proportion to the Nitre.
Consequently‚ this Method is not so profitable as
the former (ξ 1 ¹3-) as it requires Vessels confiderably
larger.

118. As the extracted Spirits of Nitre are very
difficultly condensated into Drops, especially in a sul-
try Summer’s Hecu, it will not be improper on ac-
count ofthe calcined Ingredients to pour into the Re-
cipient one quarter-part of pure W'ater, and, what
is still better, of Phlegm extrat‘ted out osqum Fortis:
By which Artifice the Spirits will be much exstet
received.

119. Aqua Fortis dissolves and coi-rodes all gritty
Stena, and the several Kinds os those that are vitri-
ficable and not consumcd by Fire3 but it has no
Power on Flints‚ nor os course on Sami, as this con-
srsts of minute Stones of the same Kind.
