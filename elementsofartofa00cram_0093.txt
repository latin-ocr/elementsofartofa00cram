Inches and a half distant from each Side of the Fur-
nace ·, and finally, a fifth Hole (p), at the Height of
one Ineh above the upper Edge ofthe upper Door (f). “
7. In short, let the Infide of the Furnace be armed
with iron-Hooks, jetting out half an Inch, and

.
³ · about three Inches distant from each other, to fasten

 

 

the Lute with which the Furnace is to be covered
over within. 8. Let then an iron, moveable, hollow,
quadrangular Pyramid (q) three Inches high, be ad-
apted to the upper Aperture (d) of the Furnace at
the Basis seven Inches broad, ending upwards in a
hollow Tube (r) three Inc‘nes in Diameter, two In-
ches high, almost cylindrical, though somewhat con-
vergent at Top. This prominent Tube serves to
support a Funnel or Flue, which is almost cylindrical‚
hollow, made of Iron Plates, and two Foot high (t),
and which, when a very strong Fire is required, is put
perpendicularly upon the {horter Tube, in such Μαι]-
ner, that it enters close into it one Inch and a half or
two Inches deep, and may again be taken offat Plea-
sure, when there is no need of so strong a Fire. But
this pyramidalCover (q)must befides have two Handles
(s s) adapted to it, that it may be laid hold of, and thus
be taken away or put on again. And, that this be-
ing put on the Aperture (d) of the Furnace, may not
be easily thrown down, let an Iron Plate be rivetted
to the right and left upper Edge ofthe Fornace (c c),
and be turned down towards the Inside, so as to
make a Furrow open before and behind, into which
the laterai Edges. of the Cover may enter and be fast-
ened, and at Pleasure be moved backwards and for-
wards, whenever it must be put on, or removed. 9.
Let a square Ledge, made of a thick iron-Plate
(Fzgg. IL) be fastened at top of the upper Edge of the
lower Door (e) 3 this is designed to support the Grate
and the Lute. But it must be made of two Pieces,
that it may be easliy introduced into the Cavity ofthe
Furnace. Thus you will have an aflay Oven, which
must afterwards be covered over inwardly on the In-
side with Lute : This you are to do as follows r,
