yvhichwas in the Vitriolr Nay5 this Gilla is more
lmpregnated with Copper, than the Vitriol out of the
Caput Mortuum of which, it has been made. For
Allom most difficultly loses its Acid in the Fire:
Therefore‚ ifyou pour &Vater upon it, after a strong
Calcination, it may be reduced almost totally to Cry-
stals again. Likewise‚ Copper is not so easlly de-
prived of 311 its Acid by Fine, as Iron is, though the
former be precipitated by the latter,

2. The Vitriols of Iron * and of Copper may
easily be produced by Art, and even that of Iron by
firnply pouring upon it Oil of Vitriol, diluted with fix
or eight Times as much Water‚ when it is too rnuch

concentrated (Part Ι. § 109.) But the Solution must x

be left for one or two Duys in a moderate Heat‚ and
more Iron be added than the Oi] of Vitriol can dis-
solve. Then, when the Solution is thoroughly sepa-
rated, filtrate it, evaporate it, and reduce it to Crys-
tals 35 before, and you will have green Crystals:
This Solution also lets fall a great Qantity of yel-
low Oker during every Inspiffation3 and even when
you let it rest for one or two Days, it grows opaque,
and assumes a rusty Colour. But, if you let fall into
it a few small Drops of Oil of Vin-iol, to make it
very ssightly Acid, it remains long limpid, and if
it is inspiffated and put at Rest for a Crystallization‚
thi's yellow martial Earth doth not subfide: The
Crystals which are then produced, become less yellow
of a Grass—colour, and keep 'their Whiteness and
Transparency longer, but ure a little more Acid.
Thence it 15 plain, how vain 15 the Labour of those
who try to puriFy the Vitriol of Iron, by these re-
peated Solmions, Inspissation5‚ and CrystallizationS.
Por, it is totally resolved into these okery Dregs, and
ifit contains any Copper, there remains at last almost ,
mere Vitriol of Copper. .
