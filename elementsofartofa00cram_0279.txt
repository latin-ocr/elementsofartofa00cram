till an the remaining Powder be washed off at last.

Then dry the remaining Amalgama with a Spunge,
and by a gentle Heat.

T he Ust and Reafims of the Proccss.

1. Amalgamation is chiefly used, when Silver lies·
hidden in its metallick Form in Stones, Earths‚ and
Sand. But when it is in a State of Ore, the Bodies
that concur with it to form the Ore, must be diffi-
pated (Part 1. §463): Otherwise, the Amalgatna-
tion would not succeed. Therefore‚ a previous Wash-
ing must be made, that the other Bodies which can-
not be diffolved by the Mercury, rnay be wafhed off
as much as possible: For, unless this be done, the
Mercury cannot a& freely upon the Silver ε Nay, if
the Washing is done afterwards, a great Deal of the
Mercury is wassied off together with these heteroge-
neous BodieS. For which Reason, likewise, the Ore
is soak'd in Vinegar prepared with Allum, that the
terrestrial dusty Bodies, or even the fat Ones, may
be wiped off the Surface of the Silver. As for the
rest, see Part I. ξ 6 5. and follow. For this Reason,
the Mercury sometimes refuses to dissolve the Silver :
Which nevertheless is corret‘ted‚ if the Mercury is
rubbed with common Salt and Water, and afterwards
washed very clean.

2. If you continue to grind the Amalgama with
Water, longer than till you see no more Filth in it ς
the Water poured upon it will nevertheless be always
turbid, and you will lose Part of your Amalgama.

a great Qantity of Amalgamations are made, and
