But Mr. Swedenborge has colle-&ed all these Things ψ.
This Separation is performed chiefly by two Opera-
tions·, viz. ajust proportioning the Mixture with
Lead‚ and the running off the Lead‚ from the Gold
and Silver diffolved by it. As the Lead is not perfcffly
separated from the Copper byFusion, but there remains
a Qantity of it adher-ing to the Copper(Pr0c.XXXV)‚
and there remains also some Gold and Silver in the
Copper, according to the Qantity of the remaining
Lead3 for this Reason‚ the Silver and Gold ought
to be diluted in such a Qantity of Lead, that in
that Portion of Lead‚ which cannot be run off, so
small a Qiantity of the above-mentioned Metals may
remain diffolved‚ as doth not deserve the Addi-
tion of more. Leacl. You are to observe, that,
in the Computation of the Expence3‚ you must have
Regard to the Loss of Lead and Copper ·, since
it is sels-evident, that Part of these Metals must
be lost in the Course of this ProcesS. You are
likewise to examine with the same Exathess as
in the Copper, by coppellfflg, what »iantity of
Silver there is in the Lead wherewith the Sepa-
ration is to be made: For, it is the sanie Thing
whether Silver and Gold were already in the Lead
which is to be melted down, or whether they
have been received by it out of the Copper, in the
Fufion of it with the Lead. Finally, a certain Pro·
portion is required between the Lead and the Copper ς
for, if the Lead exceeds ever so little the quadruple
Qantity of the Copper, you will hardly avoid the
falling of the latter into small ssioe, and a great Dcal
of it is carried away by the melted Lead. For this
Reason‚ likewise‚ you are to add to your Copper‚
which is easy to be melted by itsclf as well as with
