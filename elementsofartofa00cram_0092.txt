ches and a half high in the Middle. 4. Then fasten
three Iron Plates on the fore-Part of this Furnace:
Let the first of them (g g) eleven Inches, long, and
half ah Inch high, be clapped, its lower Edge‚·a-
gainst the Bottom of the Fornace, with three or four
Rivets, in such a Mamer, that there may be, between
the npper Edge of the said Plate and the-‘Side of the
Fornace, a Groove so wide, as that the Siiders of the
lower Door (k k) may be put into it, and freely
move backwards and forwards therein: These must

⁸ be made of a thicker iron-Plate. The second iron-

Plate (h h), eleven Inches long, three Inch‘es high,
and perfeffly parallel to the foregoing Plate, must
be clapt in the Space between the two Doors, in such
Manner, that both the upper and the lower Edge of
it, may form a hollow Groove with the Side of the
Fornace. One of these Grooves, which looks down-
wards, serves to receive the upper Edges of the Sli-
ders, that lhut the lower Door (N0 2). The other
that locks upwards, is to receive the inferior Edges
of the Sliders of the small Door above (N⁰ 3). The
third Plate (i i) which is like the first, must be rivetted
close above the upper Door, in such Mamer, that it
may form a Groove looking downwnrds, and con-
tignous to the npper Edge of the upper Door (N0 3.)
5. In order to shut both Doors (N02. and 3) you
‘must adopt to each of them two Sliders made oi Iron
Plures, that may rnove within the above-mentioned
Grooves (k k l l.) Eut the two Sliders belonging
to the upper Door (N0 3.) must have each a Hole
near the Top 3 tharis, one a small Hole ᾧ Part of
an Inch broad, and one Inch and a half long (m) ;
and the other a Semi-circular Aperture, one lnch
high and two Inches broad (n). 'Let besides each
Slider have a Handle, that they may be laid hold of,
when they are to be moved. 6. Morewer, let five
round Holes,0ne Inch broad, be bored in the Furnace:
Two of which must be”made in the fore-Part of the
Fornace (o o), two others in the back Part, all at the
Height of five Inches from the Bottom, but thhoe
