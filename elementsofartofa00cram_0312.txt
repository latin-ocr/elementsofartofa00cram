gentle Fue, which is sufficient to melt the Sulphur,
resolve the Sulphur partly into Fumes, and finally
make it burn ε When the Flame is vanished, increase
the Fire, that the Vessel may grow red hot ς When
you see no longer any Smoak smelling of Sulphur,
add a Qantity of Boi-ax, which rnust be previoussy
melted, and of glus—Gall, and melt the whole jn a
great Fire : You shall have a Regulus of Gold at the

Bottom.

The Uſs’ and Reasbm of the Process³

1. Gold, Aqua Regis, and alkaline fixt Sale, when
exposed to the F ire, do not fulminate ; nor any two
of these jointly ; except tha-t the fixt Alkali makes
a small craekling Noise with the Acid of sea-Salt,
and Nitre accelerates with great Violence the con-
suming of inflammable Bodies in the Fire: But all
the three united together by Diffolution and Precipi-
tation, produce this Phenomenon beyond all Expec-
tation. No Body has been able hitherto to give
any Explication of this Event : For those who at·
tribute the Cause of it to the regenerated Nitre, do
not confidet that Nitre produces no F ulmination, un-
less you add a Phlogiston to it, and use a greater
Fire than that required by fulminating Gold ε Now,
there is not in the purest alkaline fixt Salt
a sufficient Phlogiston, nor do they detonate‚
when only joined to each other. But those who
fancy that the Nitre has this Phlogiston from
the Gold, are no less wrong: For in this Case, the
Mixture of Gold would be diffolved: Whereas it
happens on the contrary, that the Gold appears again
perfect in the Form of a very fine Powder‚ when
this Fulmination is performed with very small Por-
tions‚ under a large glass-Bell‚ and upon a very neat
Surface. The crackling Noise of common salt, is
no better an Explanation of the Case : For though
it agrees in every Respest with the Fulmination of
Gold, except the Violence 3 nevertheless, the Pre-
cipitation of fultninating Gold by a volatile Alkali,
