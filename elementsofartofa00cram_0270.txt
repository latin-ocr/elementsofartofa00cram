Silver may be intirely immersed: Then throw into
the Liquor a Qantity of sea-Salt, and Tartar: Put
the whole together upon the F ire, and make it boil :
Thus will the Copper be eroded from the Surface in a
few Hours, and the Silver remain alone. Therefore‚
though you had put the most polished Lamina into
the F ire, you will take it out quite destitute of Bright-
ness, but of the whitest Colour. Then wth it with
Small- Beer, and rub the Surface of the Silver‚ with
Brushes ma’de of thin brass- Wires. But if this Surface
is again rubbed with a smooth Piece of Steel‚ it reco-

vers its former Polishing.1t is here necessary to
know this deceitful Colour, not only when you use
the (Part Ι. §300 ) Touch- stone, but also m a doci-

mastical Trial· . For when t'ne Specimen taken off
from such Silver, is thin‚ or of a large Surface, it
leaves more Silver in the Coppel, than if you cut
from that Silver a small Bit of the same Weight‚ in a
Place where a leffer Surface has been contiguous to
the corroding Solution.

APPARATUS.

REAK your Ore in an iron-Mortar‚ to ‘a
Powder not very fine: Weigh twenty or

thirty docimasticalCentners of it, in a large Balance. ·
Put them into a washing Trough (PartI. Plat.11.
F g XVI.) pour some Watex· upon thern, that the
Powder of the Ore may be thoroughly mo’ist: Then
have a Veffel full of Water, the Diameter of which
must be a littlelarger than the Length of the Trough· .
Take the Trough with your left-Hand, at the Top
of the hinder- Part, and dip it horizontally into the
water, and move it gently with your right· Hand,
