139, The purest Gelai, when rmelted with Brimstone,
remains perfeftly the same as before 3 it lets the Sul-
phur burn very freely, remaining itself at the same
Time entire, provided it was very well cleansed
before.

140. Silmr, when it begins to grow red hot in the
Crucible, melts immediately by adding Brinzffos-oe,
which of course renders it more speedily fluid.
When poured out, it proves a Mass that curs very
easily, very malleable, of the Colour and Consistence
of Lead. However, this Mass being a second Time
exposed to a very great and long lasting Fire, is again
freed from the Sulphur, which is then diffipated ;
and then it germinates into a kind of woolly Sub-
stance, in case the Fire be ssackened towards the
End.

141. Tin granulated‚ and stratified with an equal
or a double Qantity of Brimstone‚ deflagrates in the
Fire as if Nitre had been added, and leaves the fluid
Mass, which becomes solid and consistent, while it is
yet red in the Fire: Whence it is plain, that the Fu-
fion of Tin is retarded by Sulphur. The remaining
Regulus, under the Hammer‚ is very brittle‚ much
like a Semi-Metal, and of the Colour of Leacl. But
the Part of the Tin thus turned into Scorioe, looks
like Ashes and Dust at Topr but darker coloured and
cleaner within. The whole Mass of the Tin will turn
into the like Scorioe‚ by continuing to burn it with
fresh Additions of Brimstone.

142. Lead melted with Brimstone‚ after the Defin-
gration turns into a Mass hardly fufible by a great
Fire, friable, confisting of very bright Panicles, and
with which the Crucible is seen to be wholly in-
crustated.

143. Copper made into Strata with an equal Qan-
tity of Brimstone, melts immediately in the Fire, and
turns into a black brittle Mass. The same thing
happenS‚ when you pour Brimstone upon Copper tho-
roughly red hot.
