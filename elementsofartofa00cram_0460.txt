bles, being melted in a strong Fire, turn to Glass‚
wi'th which you may likewise melt a Qantity
of Sand, or of pulverized Flints‚ which may be
in greater Proportion, as the Ashes were more Salt.
This Glass is the hardest of all, more refractory in
the Fire than the other common Glaffes, perfeffly
refisting the Air and VVater, and all liquid Menstrua
that are known: On which Account it is not to be
esteemed less than the finest crystaline Glass‚ because
of its vast Usefulness. Its Colour is commonly of a
dark green Dye‚ sometimes quite opaque and black.
The Reason of this incomparable Durableness con-
fists in the perfect Mixture of the Salt and the Earth,
as likewise in the great Qantity ofthe latter, where-
by it surpaffes the former much more than in any
other Glass. salt, for Instance, is most equally and
minutely divided through the Ashes3 whence its
diffolving Virtue is so much increased, that this little
Qantity of Salt is able to bring so great a Qantity
of a very 1·efra<story Earth, to a State of Fufion.

Roastings and Edulcorations, and rendered so pure
as to be used for the making of Coppels‚ if you mixt
