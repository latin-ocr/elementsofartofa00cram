140 The ART of

of the reddest Colour, of a middling VVeight, ten-
der, so that it may be easlly scraped and figured with
a Knife 3 it has a soapy Feeling : when exposed to a
great Fire, it grows very hard, and affumes a darker
‘and lhining Colour 3 ’11 contains much Iron in it.

356. It has been observed‚ that whenever Sand is
of'a blackish Die, it has Iron or Lead in it. But its
great Weight lhews, that it contains a confiderable
Qantity of Metal.

357. We might very well range in the sarne Chss,
all native vitriolicMinerals ·‚ such as [he stalaclicVitrioL
and the Stones used for the making of Iul< : for they
either are purely of Iron, or at least, confist in great
Part of Iron corroded by the Acid of Sulphur. We
might also place here the Lapis'Calamam-is, and many
other Minemls ·‚ but ns the several Metals drawn out
of them, require each a special management, wc
{hall [reat of thern 111016 at large hereafter.

358. The Mineral called Flosferri‚ or Elossorns of
Iron, is nothing buta St21lac'lites(§ 30, 3), resemb-
ling a Germination like that of Coral. , Itis called
Ferri Flos‚* because it has now aud then been found
about a calcareous iron-Ore : Nor does it seem to de-
scrve this Name, upon any other Account.

359. There is found, in several iron-MineS, espe-
cially those of Sweden and Norway ἦ, an Ore called
the Magnet or Load-stone: which is a black ponderous
Smne, not very hard, when pure. It is often inter-
mixt with Flints and Spaud, in which Case it 15 less
good. You may see the wonderful Properties of this
Stone, mentioned in the Writings of Naturalists.
But we shall here chiefly treat of that of its Qualities‚
by which we may find out the occult Presence of Iron.
The Load-stone attra&s Iron at a great Distance, and
holds it strongly to itself‚ unless an exceffive Weiglu,
or some other Obstacles hinder the Effe&; nor is
there any other Body but Iron, that is attraclted in

³⁸⁶ And in many Parts of E ngland, whereof several Specimens are to
be seen in the Maſsam of the qual Society.
