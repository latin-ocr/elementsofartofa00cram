ASSAYING METALs. 371

and when you open them, a very thin Fume of the
garlick-like Smellof Arsenick‚ will break forth, and
vanish very soon after. The Recipient will be co-
vered over on the Infide, with a Coat of very sofr,
impalpable, and light Flowers of a bluilh white Co-
lour: But, the Aludel will be incrustated, partly
with the more ponderous blue F lowers, consisting of
coarser Graius, and partly with the solid Sublimate
produced from the small Drops of rnelted Zink en-
tirely sublimed‚ the grey Flowers of the destroyed
Zink being every where interposed. You will
find in the earthen Veffel itself something still of the
Zink covered and sheltered as it were with a Blister,
from being entirely burnt, or sublimed : Which is the
F lowers burm, and almost half vitrified. If you use
a Fire so gentle, as that the Zink may not take
Flame ς hardly any Thing will evaporate in Form of
Zink, or of Flowers.

2, If you expose to a middling Fire having a
Draught of Air, two or three Ounces of Zink, in an
open earthen Cucurbite‚ upon a stone Support‚ as
one places a Crucible; Zink takes Flame much sooner
than in a close Vefl'cl, and fills the whole Cavity of
the Veffel with very white Flowers like Locks of
Wool : But, so soon as the Veffel is full with these
Flowers, so as that you can no longer see the Surface
of the Zink ς the F lame, which was very bright be-
fore, gradually diminilhes, till it at last ceases entirely ἱ
so that the Zink can no more be brought to a Deflra-
gratim, not only with the same, but also with a strong-
er F ire. If then you take away the Flowers with a
small iron Ladle‚ and free the Surface of the melted
Zink at the Bottom of the Veffel‚ from those
which covered it; a bright Flame is again pro-
duced as before, and in a few Minutes the Cavity of
the Veffel is filled with Flowers of the same Kind:
If you continue this Work in the same Manner ·‚ at
last all your Zink, provided it was pure, is resolved
1nto a great Qantity of very white Flowers·, nor does
a great Deal of it fly away, unless the Fire acts too

B b 2 violently.
