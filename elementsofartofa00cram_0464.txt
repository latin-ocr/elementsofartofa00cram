Border and the Bottom of the Pot: Then let the
Lye g ow cold‚ and rest for afew Hours; which
done, you may tali e out a great Qattn tity of the
purest Salt, with an Iron· ladle: Continue to inspiffate
the Refie rue of the I yc in the same Manner, till no
more Salt can be separated 1n this Mamer, and the
remaining Lye turns to a muddy Liqu0r‚ which
serves to make the coarser Kinds of Glass ε When
the first Salt is perfeclly clean, dry it, If-you purify
your Salt thus once more, it will be fit sor making
the finest GlaffeS. Salt extracied out of Ashes‚ and
then purified, and calcined‚ may at once be rendered
as pure as it can ever be by any Art, if by expoling it
to a· pretty moist Air, you let in run to Wa-
ter and crystallize the Oleum per Deliquium of it,
in the Manner aforesaid. But it is not necessary
to bestow so much Labour for small Experi-
ments‚ if you are willing to have the finest crys-
talline Classes, Pot-ash is to be bought very
cheap every where, which have already been ren-
dered sufficiently acrid, by being burnt in thc Fue,
and become most fit for this Purpose, when they have
been purified from the neutra] Salt (which is most
difficultly diffolved in Water) and from thc coarse
Earth wherewith they are sull, by a Solution in four
Times the Qantity of cold VVaten or much better
by decanting, and then strained‚ and at last crystal-
lized. There are also some other Salts which enter
into the Compofition of Glaffes, especially Nitre,
which, if not pure, must be purified by Solution‚
and by pouring gently upon it a few Drops of Oil of
Tartar per Deliquium, and finally by Crystallization.
