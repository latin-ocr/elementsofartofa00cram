1. Nitre is produced out of soft Earths*i11]pregnat-
ed with fat and saline Particles of vegetable and animal
Bodies apt to come to a Putrefaffion. But Nitre is ne-
verfound perse& in them, unless fixtAlkali, or a limy
Earth be joined to them. It is then proper to add
alkaline Salts to the Earths in which Nitre is to be
generated‚ or at least to mix alkaline Ashes or Lirne
to thern, while the nitrous Earth is boiling for a Lye.
For, it is certain *from unquestionable Experiments,
that these Things enter really into the Compofition
of Nitre, This is plain, from the abundant Quantity
of Alkali that comes from Nitre by Means of a very
small Qantity of Coals of Vegetables‚ having no ἧκε
Alkali in them, such as proceed fron] Mustardseed,
and the like: For if such Coals being put upon melted
Nitre, detonare with it by increafing the Fire to a
high Degree, and the Mass is brought to a Fufion
like Water after the Detonation is compleated, you
will have above one Half of fixt alkaline Salt‚ with
regard to the Nitre employed ; unless you have flung
rnuch of it out of the Veffels, on Account of their
snmssness, or by putting imprudently too much Char-
coal at once. This Alkali is called fixt Nitre, and
is a little less Fusible than any other pure fixt Alkali,
because of the subtil calcareous Earth which is in it.
Nor does there then remain any Vestiges of Nitre in
it, which is detested by pouring in Oil of Vitriol
to a perfect Saturation. For, if there remains any
Nitre, this Refidue will affe& the Nose with an

²¹⁸ Large Qantities of Nitre are extrasted at Paris, out of the.
Rubbish of old Buildings 3 which are there all made of Stone and
Smne-mortar. The greatest Qantities of Nitre, whereof the Con-
sumption is now become so great for the making Gunpowder‚ are
brought from the Edi-India, but it is not yet known to us whether
it is an artificial Compofition made by the Inhabitants of the inland
Countries, or whether there really are any Mines of native salt-
petre, or any natural Earum, out of which it can be extrasted.
