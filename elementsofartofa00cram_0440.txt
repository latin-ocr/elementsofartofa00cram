itis Vitriol‚ you must throw it away : But the Allum
must be purified byfla repeated Solution and Crystali-
zation, which will be of a reddish bay Colour. Con-
tinue the same with what remains of the Solution,
till it is intirely exhausted of Allum.

2. But if no Allum is precipitated, the Solution
must again boil on the Fire, then pour into it about
one twentieth Part of saturated Lye of Por-aih, or
one third Part of putrified Utine, or also some
Qick-lime: Mean while, continue to boil it: If
there is any Allum, a white Precipitatc will begin to
be expelled, when the greatest Part of the Solution
is ccnsumed : Then let it cool and rest, and decant
the Solution from what is precipitated, and out of this
remaining Solution the Rest ol the Allum will be pre-
cipitated in the Manner already mentioned, till there
remains at list a thick l iquor void of Allun1.T his
done, dissolve again in a iufficient Qantity of boil· ⁴
ing water, all0 that has b en precipitatech purify

it by letting it rest, or by Filtration‚ and reducing
to Crystals according to Proc. LXXIV.

ι. Alium precipitated by itself, conlists of a mere
Barth, reduced into a Form of Salt by a vague foffile
Acid. But this Earth is of a most singular Nature,
and different from the other native Earths that are
known. For, with Chalk, Lime‚ and Spaad, dis· Α
solved in this Acid, you will produce Salts somewhat
like Allum, though never perfefftly resembling it.
But, if this Earth is of that Kind, the Allum is white,
or of a light reddish Colour. · And when a Metal ,
mixes to it in the Forrn of Virriol, it is tinged with ’ς
a bluish greenishColour: And the Allum m this Case ¹:
must be look ed upon as impure. But, if the Precipi- ς
tation os Allurn 1s performed by a Solution of a fixt i
Alkali‚ οι· of volatile putrid Urine, then, indeed, as ᾖ
well as in all Precipitation5‚ a great Deal of the pre- ξ
cipitating alkaline Salt Joins to the Allum· VJhich
