ASSAYING METALS. ‘125

·are almost as ponderous as Metals themselves: such
are a great many Species of Spaad. ‚

308. However‚ I would not have the speci'fick
Gravity, nor the F igure be altogether overlooked,
but rather made use of with the other CharaCleris-
ticl<s3 though no constant and accurate Judgment
can always be drawn from these alone.

309. But our Design being to lay down the Prin-
ciples of the Art of Affaying3 it will be neceffary
only, to mention the Characteristicks and distinguish-
ing Mai-ks of compound MineraIS, as they are the
most frequent Objecsts of the said Art (§ 2), and to
shew their constituent Parts, as far as they make
themselves known, together with the Disposition of
the whole Body with several Menstrua. It is likewise
, evident, that we cannot here mention all Ores with·
out Excepdon, but that we must only chuse those that
are less compound, or those at least which are more
frequently met with.

3¹0· We shall refer every compound Mineral to
the Class of that Simple, of which it contains the
greatest Part in itself; except however Slones, and
simple Earths : for if the Classes of these were to be
deterniined from their predoniinant Parts ς the Num-
ber of the Ores to be referred to that Class, would be
by much the greatest.

Scholion. For Instmzce, let us stappofi>‚ that there are
in a Lamp, fix Parts of Copper‚ one of Sulphur, a
eevery small ‘antz'ty of Arsenicri‘, and twenty Parts of
Qtartz or Plint-sione3 we shall claſs this compozmcl
Bady with the C oppa-kind, amiso οη.

311. But we ssiall call a Mineral proper to that
Simple, which makes the greatest Part of it (§ 310),
and improper to those which it contains in less Qan-
tity : However‚ they are contained in it in such Man-
ner, that they indeed enter into the Mixture of it,
and must always accompany it wherever such Mineral
is found. F inally, we ssiallcall it accidental to those
Simples‚ which enter not into the Mixture of it, be-

ing only adherent to the Out·fide: Wherefore‚ they
