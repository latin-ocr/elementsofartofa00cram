ASSAYING METALS. ''2-‚17

or Lstharge, which being perpetually reproduced by
the Regulus, had covered the Surface of it, is as it
were pulled off. If the Fire at that Time is not
strong enough to keep the Silver in a State of Fufion3
the Colour of the Regulus of Silver remaining-gg
changes suddenly from a faint fire Colour, to a shin-
ing one: Which Brightness is called in German
fflitkelt. But if you have used in the End so great
a Fire, as that the pure Silver may be kept in Fufion,
this Alteration of Colour does not appear, but the
granulated Metal continues to ssiine bright. Silver,
in the Moment it grows solid, commonly emits out
ofitself Ramifications like aVegetation‚ and which
are sometimes very delicate and elegant.

4. When the Phenomena above—mentioned (Νο. 3.)
have been seen, leave the Coppel still one or two
Minutes under the Muffel ; then take it out, and
with a Pair of Tongs (Part J. Pleu. IV. [ἧς. ΙΙΙ.)
take away the Metal in Grains ε And if any Scoria
or any Bit of the Coppel should happen to adhere
to it, wrap it up in a Paper, and press it between
a strong Pair of TongS, or between the Chops of a
Vice: That the brittle Dross may go off without
Loss of the Regulus; which shall be very white,
and full of small Pits underneath : But ifit is tinged
with a neat yellow Colour ς you may be sure that
it containsa great Deal of Gold.

5. If you want next to determine how rnuch Silver
you have fetched out of the Ore, put in one Scale
the Effer-Regulus, which has remained of the Re-
gulus in the Scorificatior13 and put in the opposite
Scale, together with the Weights‚ the Regulus which
remained in the other Coppel, out of the same
Qantity of granulated Lead, as you have used for
the Scorification: For the Lead by which the Scoti-
fication has been made, contained as much Silver·;
and this has joined itself by the Force of the Opera-
tion3‚ to the Regulus obtained out of the Ore.
