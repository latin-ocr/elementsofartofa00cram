284 The ΛΒΤ 'of

The Use and Reastms of the Procefi.
1. This Method of Proceeding‚ is used only in

. sucha Case when you have a great Qantity of Sil·

ver mixt with a small Qantity of Gold, nor can you
determine the smallest Portion of Gold that will
answer the* Charges and Trouble of the Separation.
Nevertheless, when Coals are cheap, and you have
a good Qantity of Silver niixt with Gold, you may
with some Profit separate one or two Grains (Part I.
ξ) 285.) or even one Penny-weight of Gold from it.

2. The Diffolution of Silver by Sulphur is perform-
ed in a close Veffel 3 otherwise, a vast Qantity of
Sulphur would evaporato before the Diffolution should
be made ; unless you fix it by some other Body, for
Instance by the reguline substance of Antimony‚ as
in Proc. XXVII, which Body, however, must not
hinder the Aetion of the Sulphur upon the Silver.

Let a precipitating Flux be sprinkled as equally
as poffible upon the melted Mixture : For if this be
neglested, and the Flux is gathered in a Heap in
any particular Place of the Surface 3 the granulated
Lead which enters into the Flux, creeps out of it as
soon as it melts, and coming down into the Mixture
precipitates the Silver, which brings the Gold along
with it from that Column only through which the
Lead descends, and falling further down, leaves the
rest, which is adherent to the Sides, in the Mix-
ture. For the same Reason, you must also stir up
the F lux together with the Mixture‚ with an iron-
Hook. Likewise‚ Salt5‚ Litharge, Iron, and Cop-
per, perform a precipitation, by absorbing the Sul-
phur, but they do it slower and more equally than
Lead, and the two last still better, rendering at the
same Time the Mixture specifically lighter‚ and more
fufible, so that the Precipitation of the Particles of
Gold and Silver is the better performed, and they
hinder too great a Diffipation of the Sulphur. For
this Reason, Gold mixt with a small Qantity of

Silver
