proceed from the Copper carried away along with
them, being otherwise like the F lowers produced
(Proc. LXV) : But, in this Case, agreat Part of the
Weight of the Copper is lost at the same Time, and
the Colour of it grows every instant worse and worse.
For this Reason, when you tinge Copper with Cala-
mine‚ to get Profit by it, you must try by Expe-
riments, what Degree of Fire you are to use, and in
what Time the Copper acquires the greatest Weight,
and affumes the finest Colour: For, it is plain to the

Eye‚ that a great Deal of it also vanishes in Form of v

a thick F ume. However‚ it is obstrvable, that Brass
or Copper impregnated with Zink‚ being made mid-
dling red-hot in the Firc, is not so easily calcined as
pure Copper. There are also a great many Differ·
ences in the Calamine ε For, a Qantity of some Ca-
lamine increases the Weight of Copper, more than
the same Qantity of some other does. The Beauty
and Malleability of the tinged Metal are likewise dif-
ferent: For, some Calamine affords a great Deal of
Lead and Iron; whereby the Copper is spoiled and
rendered pale and brittle 3 though the Weight of it
is very much increased at the same Time. There are
even some Species of this Smne, that require a pre· ’
vious Roaffing, whereby a great Part of it must b'e
dissip-ared, before it is rendered fit for this Use·,
while others may be immediately made Use of.

2. There are befides the Calamine‚ many com-
pound artificial Bodies, which likewise tinge Copper
with a yellow Colour‚ and increase the Weight of it:
Such as are the Cadmiae Fornacmn, or Tutty (Part I.
ᾗ 89) 3 but, all Kinds of Tutty are not so, but those
only which proceed from Zink-ores, or from com-
pound Metals in which Zink enters: Of which all
that has been said of the Calamine is equally true.
A most elegant and pure Kind of it, is the Tutty used
in the Apothecaries Shops ε It is very ponderous and
solid, resembling cylindrical Segrnents by its Figure,
rendered convex and hollow by the Obstacle to which
the Vapours have applied themselves, granulated εἰη
