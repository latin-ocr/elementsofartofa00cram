and among these chiefly the light pyritose ones
But the Wishing ofthe other Ores succeeds likewise
the better, because the tin· Ore is not ιο easily coni
minuted to a fine Powder, as the other Ores are ς
- except, however, iron— Ores, which are the most
rigid and hardest of them all. The tin· Ore is alwiys
found of a solid ἕξ Figure, and when pounded, it
always retains a † solid granulated Form. This
Ore will sometimes bear a pretty strong Roasting,
without falling into small Bits on this Account.
Therefore, when hard, ponderous Stones are to be
washed off, it will be no Detriment to the tin· Ore,
if they are previoussy disposed by Fire for an easy
Comminution. Nor do the interspersed Pyrites turn
less into a light dusty Caput Mortuum, when the
Roasting is but gentle at first, and repeated several
Times ε Whereby the copper and iron-Particles‚ are
afterwards eafily washed off by Elutriation. But if
there remains a hard, more intricate, ponderous
{ron-Ore, not easy to be calcined, it is attracted with
the Load-stone after the Roasting and the Elutriation.
But the Separation of the Copper- ores, and of the
iron pyritose Ones from the tin· Ore before the melt-
ing, is the more to be regarded, because none are
found mixt with the tin· Ores so frequently as these:

But as fin diffolves Iron and Copper, and even with
a Fire much milder than is required to make them
melt of themselves ·‚ it is easy to conceive, that all is
confounded, when a reducing Fusion is made, be-

¹fore the Separation of both by Elutriation or by the q

Load-stone has been previoussy made : Whence the
Confistence of the Tin thereby produced, is spoiled,
and it is rendered unfit for a great many Uses. But
a most. exact Separation of the Earths and Stones
from the tin Ore is required·, becmse reduced Tin
