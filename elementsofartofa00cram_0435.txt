that with regard to it, it is as pure as the factitious
'Vitriol of Iron (ΝΟ. 2.)

4. Vitriol of Copper is prepared in an instant with
Oil of Vitriol as (ΝΟ. 2.) : But, this is not so much
saturated with Metal : For, Copper does not so readily
yield to ΟΞ] of Vitriol‚ as Iron does. The Opera-
tion succeeds better, if you stratify Plates of Copper
with Sulphur in an Earthen-Veflel, shut close with
a Tile and with Lute‚ and then put the Veffel into Ἴ
the Fire, till it is middling red-hot. Thus the Plates
are corroded by the Sulphur‚ and become of a dark
Colour‚ and much thicker than they were before:
This is called burnt Copper. The Copper being pe-
netrated by the Sulphur‚ is afterwards roasted in a
moderate open Fire‚ till you no longer see any sul-

phureous Flame: Thus by pouring Water upon it
you may get a very fine arzure—coloured Solution of

Vitriol of Copper‚ which must be reduced to Crys-

APPARATUS.

1. Very great Qantity of common Vitriol‚ such

asis sold in the Shops, is got out of Pyrites ε
Some of them having very little or no Copper in
them, when exposed to the Air, turn of themselves
to Ink—stoneS. These are merely charged with Sul-
phur, and very little arsenical. However, they do not
all so eafily turn to Vitriol: And some of them will
not do it at all. They must be beaten to a coarse

Powder‚ and thus exposed to a pretty moist Airi
