ASSAYING METALS. 419

Odour of Spirit of Nitre, by expelling the Spirit
of it. This Presence of fixtAlkali in Nitre, is like-
wise testified by the Regeneration of it out of Spi-
rit os Nitre and Alkali. Nitre agitated with a strong
Fire, in a strong open Crucible, is at last diffipated
in Form of Smoak (Prae. XIV), there remaining a.
very small Quantity of Alkali ·‚ which is, however,
likewise diffipated by continuing the Fire, because
it is not absolutely fixt. Moreover, the superfluous
calcareous Earth, which has been introduced in a
saline Form by the Spirit of Nitre, and is contained
in the Lye, is precipitated by the fixt Alkali. This
appears in great Qantities, especially in the last re-
maining Lye of the first Crystallization, unless it has
been already precipitated‚ during the boiling of the
Lye itsels‚ by the Abundance of Alkali : It is called
the white Manganeye. But we are informed, by drop-
ping in Oil of Viti-iol, that there is Spirit of Nitre in
this Refidue ; and if it is distilled with this Oil, the
collected Spirits are Aqua Regis: Because there re·
mains some common Salt in this Lye.

2. If Nitre is crystalized a second Time, it is still
purer. The small Clouds which appear at the Instant
of the dropping in of the alkaline Solution‚ pro-
ceed from the small Refidue os white Manganese:
But, the marine Salt is thoroughly separated by this
second Operati0n‚ because it being easily diffolvible
in Water does not turn so eafily to Crystals, as
Nitre : Therefore, the first Crystals are always purer
than those which are produced in the Crystallization
of the Refidue : Which is confirmed by the Distilla-
tion of this with Oil of Vitriol (See ΝΟ. 1).

3. Mean while, take Care, never to make the
Evaporation and Crystallization of the Salts in an
earthen—Veffel : For, let it be glazed ever so neatly‚
yet, all Salts, even the fixt alkaline ones, are notv
only absorbed thereby, but even find so ready a
Paffage through them, that lanuginous Crystals sur,
round the Veffel on the Outfide.
