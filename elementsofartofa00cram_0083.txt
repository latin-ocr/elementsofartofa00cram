ASSAYING METALS. 67

'osa Mallet : Then take away the Pestle gently; and
if the Matter is hard enough, and the ho'llow Mould
sufficiently polilhed, the Veffels may be immediately
taken out of the hollow Mould‚ by renioving the
Ring: But if the Matter is too stiff, or too moist,
and the hollow Mould not sufficiently smooth‚ take
away the Pestle and put the Mould in a dry warm
Place 3 and by this Means, the Mould may be
opened, and the small Vessel be taken out in a few
Minutes. When these Vesl'els (ᾗ 204.) are sufficient·
ly dried ς they must be baked in a Potter's Oven.
206. The larges Crucibles and melting Pots are
made in the same Manner. Only instead of a Mal-
let we use a Press, to force the Pestle into the con-
cave Mould.

tet· must be put all at vonce into the Mould: For if
you add to the Matter once compreffed a new Lunip
of the same, it does not cohere with the first: Which
happens likewise, when a Qantity of small solid,
or at least compa& Maffes are put into it, without
having first been well united by handling. Hence
come many Chinks, and Pores, in the drying and
jbaking‚ which often cannot be discovered by the
Eye, nor by the Sound when the Veffels are struck,
and mean while yield a quick Paffage through them
to the Salts. (2.) If these Veffels are not made with
a large Bottorn‚ the concave Mould must not be be-
smeered with Bacon : Otherwise, when you take out
the Peffle, the Veffel sticking to it, commonly
comes out of the concave Mould along with it 3 nor·
can it afterwards be taken off from the Pestle, unless
you break it.

208. In Fufion8‚ it is osten necessary to cover
the Veffels with Tiles .· Wherefore I give a Pic-
ture of them (Plat. ΙΙ. Fig. X). These are made of
the same Matter as the melting Pots and Crucibles*:

ἕ Α Piece of common plain Tile may serve as well, if made to
fit the Veffel.
