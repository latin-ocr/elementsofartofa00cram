194. The affaying Oven (Fornix docimasticus) or
as others call it Tegula, ‘Tcstudo ς in German, and
English Muffil‚ is an arched Covering, refisting the
strongest Fire, which, in the Operation preserves
the Coppels and Tests (§ 178, 191.) from the falling
of Ashes and Coals into thern, and at the same
tirne of such a Form‚ as is no hindrance to the Affl-
on of the Air and Fire‚ nor to the Inspection of
the Affayer.

Coroll. You may then make your Muffels of what
Form you please, provided they have the said (ᾗ 194.)
Conditions requisite.

Coppels, are most commonly made semi-cylindrical 3
but like a hollow Hemffphere, when greater Aih,
Veffels (§ 184, 185.) are imployed.

196. The Muffel must have I-Ioles in it·, (1.) That
the Affayer may eafily look into it: For which Pur-
pose the forepart of it must be quite open (Plat. ΙΙ.
Fzg. I.) (2.) That the Air may the better a& in
Conjunction with the Fire, and be inceffantly re-

without the Action of it·, which however is of an
absolute Neceffity in the Vitrification of Lead: For
when the Air is once filled with a certain Qlanti-

for which Reason a constant Renewal ofAIr is neces-
sary. (3.) Befides, these Holes serve for the Regi-
men of the Fire: For the cold Air rushing through

you {hut this Aperture in part, or even intirely with
a Door added to it, the F ire increases to the highest
Degree3 which can hardly be done so quickly by
the breathing Holes of the Furnace. (4.) That the
