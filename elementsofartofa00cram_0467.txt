‘first be baked, and glazed with a vitreous Crust of
Lithasge. rhis is done by putting Powcler of Ι 1-

tharge into the small Veffel still moist before the bak

ing of it, shal<1ng it in the Ve ssel and exposing it to
a moderate Fue, after having t hrown out wh1t ιε su

perfluous: Which may be done in thethird Chamber
ofthe Furnace. Thus you will preservt your Gl ass lr om
being tainted by small Stones and Dust loolely ad

hering to these vessels, which are then fastened by
the Litharge. Every Thing being thus prepared,
fill two Thirds of the Veffel with one Con·1pos1tion‚
and before you expose it to the strongest Fue, roast
it for an Hour in the fourth Chamber, then, put it
into the Third or Second, that it may melt thoi-ough-
ly, there it must sustain a long Fire, till it is suffici-
ently fine, and free from Bubbles : Which requires
the Space of several Horu-s, To try this, touch
the Surface of the rnelted Glziss with a new Tobacco-
pipe, to which a small Portion ol Glass will adhere
when you take it out. Take Care, in *making this
Trial not to move your Glass : For as often as you
do this, it contracts new Bubbl‘es3 which cannot:
easily go away in so tenacioris a Mass, If these
Glasses are left long enough in the strongest Fire,
they are harder and more transparent than any. If
you will have large ssits of it, it must be most ssowly
cooled in the fourth Chamber‚ and the Vessel be
broken, or be ground away upon a grinding Smne,
in the Place where it is contiguous to the Glass.
