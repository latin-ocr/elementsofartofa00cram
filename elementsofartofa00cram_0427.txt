ASSAYING METALS. 401

may be experienced in the Distillations of Tartar and
of common Soap‚ and in the Operations rnade with
reducing Fluxes 3 wherein there remains always some-
thing of the Charcoal. Arsenick, with the least
Qiantity of Phlogiston, affumes a grey, ath, and
black Colour‚ or the orange or red Colour, when
Acid of Vitriol is added to the Phlogiston. When
the Phlogiston is expelled, it appears again under its
white Colour. When white, it is again defiled with
the said Colours‚ by a small Addition of Phlogiston,
2ifit is first digested with it, and sublimed again, as
the above quoted Author says, with Oil of Al-
monds. Vid. Pyritolog. p. 558. . =

2. But, the Phlogiston is not only detained by'a fixt
Alkali ς but a great Part of the Arsenick itself is
also fixt by it to such a Degree, that it cannot be·
intirely diffipated out of it by any Fire, not even an
open one ·‚ *and even turns to Glass with it by adding
some Flints: Therefore, fixt Alkali must not be
added too liberally. Thence it is plain, that this Se·
paration of Arsenick and Sul phur does not take Place,
if the latter is mixt in too great a Qantity with the
former 3 and that you must have Recourse to other
Remedies. See Proc. LXX. and LXIX. But a
smaller Qantity of Salt is sufficient ro separate the
same Mixture of Arsenick and Phlogiston‚ in Pro-
portion, as all the Ingredients are more intimately
mixt together : Which is better obtained by a sprink-
ling with an alkaline solution, than by a dry Tritu-
ration : Because all the small Maffes of Arsenick are
surrounded and penetrated with the Salt in the
former. ·

3. It is wonderful, that this Separation of the Phlo-
giston and Arsenick can hardly be completely per·
formed by any Body‚ befides fixt-Alkali, unless
by Mercury; (see the above—cited Place) although
there are much more potent Magnets of inflammable
Matters‚ than Mercury is. The Thing cannot be
done at all with Metals 3 nay, the purest white crys-
talline Arsenick‚ sublimed upon Metals that are gra-
