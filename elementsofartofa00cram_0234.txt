(means of the Sulphur which is in the Ore 3 but when
s this is diffipated by the Violence of the F ire, it turns
into Glass or Scoria'S. But when Arsenick is predo-
minant in the Ore 3 the plumbeous Part turns im-
mediately into a very penetrating‚ and very fufible
Glass, having a diffolvingr Efficacy, unless the Arse-
nick lies hidden in a whi s Pyrite or Cobalt. For
this Reason, the fixt Part of the Ore, which is no
Silver‚ is diffolved by that Glass, melts, and affumes
the F orrn of Scoria's ε The unmetallick Earths, and
the pure Copper or lead—Ores thereto adherent, are
of this Kind. The Silver then remains immutable,
and being freed of these heterogeneous Bodies‚ which
are perfeftly diffipated and partly melted, it is preci·
pitated‚ and received by the remaining Regulus of
Lead. Therefore this Process is completed by three
distinet Operations3 ziz. (1.) by roasting, (2) by
Scorification 3 (3. .Ι by the melting Precipitation of
the Silver, which is the Result of the two former
Operations.

2. The Ore must be pulverized very fine, in or-
der to increase the Sursace3 that the Diffipation of
the Volatiles‚ and the Diffolution by Litharge may
be the sooner effected. This pulverising must then
be done, before the Ore is weighed, because there is
always some Part of the Ore adherent to the Mortar,
or the ison Plate on which it is made fine3 which
Part being lost, the Operation is not exaCt. Erker
was in the right, when he prescribed 8 Centners of
Lead, for the subduing of the fusible Ore: Neverthe-
less, it must be owned, that this Quantity is superflu-
ous in some Cases. However, as the Fluxibility of
silver- Ore depends from the Absence of Stones‚ y-Py
rites‚ &a it is easy to see, that there are an infinite
Number of Degrees of Fluxibility, which it would
be needless to determine exastly‚ and most commonly
very difficult to determine by the bare Sight. Be-
lides, a little more Lead does not render the Process
. imperfect 3 on the contrary, if you use too small a
Qantity of Lead, the Scorification is never corn-

pletely
