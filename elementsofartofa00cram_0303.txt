ASSAYING METALS. 277*

The Ψ and Reasons os the Procesi.

1. Crude Antimony, besides its reguiine Subssance‚
has in it about one Part of common Sulphm, where-
with the Regulus is joined. But this Sulphur disv
solves with greater Efficacy the Silver and Copper
wherewith the Gold is allayed, it abandons the Re

galus (Pmtl. ᾗ 147. Coroll. 3) which sml s gradu·

ally to the Bottom‚ on account of 1ts being heavier
than those Metals which arediffolved by the ῠὸυΙρΙωη

and were mixt‘ with the Gold before. But though
the Gold itself does not admit this Affion of the
Sulphur ·, yet while the Silver and Copper are cor-
roded by it, a considerable Part of it divided into
minute Particles‚ is carried away at the same Time,
and will not go again to the Bottom, unless the
Regulus itself‚ joining with it, should constitute
larger Particles, which are more quickly precipitated,
because the Surface of conta& is diminished ·‚ and so
melt into one Regulus together with the Gold remain-
ing at the Bottom of the Vessel: Whence proceeds
the pale yellow Colour of the Gold.

2. When the Regulus is separated, it must be
melted again once or twice with fresh crude Anti-
mony, that the remaining Silver and Copper may be
separated from the Gold in the same Manner.
Whence it is plain, that the more Gold is allayed
with Silver and Copper, the greater Qantity of the
Regulus of Antimony is precipitated‚ and joined
with the Gold3 and on the contrary. Thence again,
the Reason is plain, why the Separation of Gold from
Silver and Copper is not performed as well as could be
wished with the Sulphur alone? Nor is it less evident
thence, that the Separation of Gold from Silver and
Copper must be attributed chiefly to the Sulphur of
Antimon

3. Ttheg ulus of Antimony, which becomes vo·
latile by a m‘i'ddfing Fire, is eafily diffipated from
the most fixt Gold, by the Blast of the Bellows3
but you lose something of your Gold, when you in-

* create the Fire too soon, and too much. Nor is it

yet easy, by this Means to bring Gold to a perse&
