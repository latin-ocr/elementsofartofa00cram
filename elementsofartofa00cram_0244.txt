PROCESS III.

To pre-cipitata with Lead by Scorificatiom Silver out of
an Ore that cannot be wafhed clean, and which is
rendered ress-abiem by a Mixture of unmetallick
Earths (Part I. ᾗ 334‚336‚338.)

THE Variety of those Things which render
Ores refractory‚ require a diri-'erent Manner of
treating them. But there are some Ores rendered
refraetory, by a Mixture of an unmetallick Earth,
some of which are, and some are not separable by
waffiing. 1f they are not separ'able‚ you must pro-
ceed in the following Manner.

APPARATUS.

1. Bruise the Ore into an impalpable Powder by
grinding in a Mortar, to a docimastical Centner of
it, a like Quantity of Glass of Lead (Part I. ἓ 54.)
finely pulverized ε For the more exaffly both these
are mixt together, the more easily the Scorification
afterwards succeeds, Put this Minore, together
with twelve Centners of Lead, into the Test, accord-
ing to the first Process (Νο. 2.) then put the Test

under the Muffel.

⁴ 2. Make first under it a strong Fire, till the Lead
boils very well : When you see it so, diminish the
Violence of the Hem, according to the first Process
{N⁰. 3.) but keep it thus diminished a little longer.
Then, finally, increase the Fire again to such De—
gree, till you perceive the Signs of a Scorification
and perfeci: Fufion. See the whole Process 1. Now,
this Process lasts a little longer than the foregoing,
and req Jlres a ‘greater Fire towards the End.

3. It iometirnes happens, that a very refrastory
