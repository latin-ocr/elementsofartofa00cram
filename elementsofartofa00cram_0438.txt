phur) does not even diffolve F ilings of Iron, unless
you pour four or s1x Times as much Water upon
them. But, the Thing being well considered, it is
certain, that there is still some other hidden Cause
of this; because it is not conceivable, why Water
poured upon some PyriteS, does immediately extract
Vitriol out of them, and none out of some others ·,
and again, why some crude Pyrites turn presently to
Vitriol in a free open Air, and never when immersed
under Water. I have rnet with such sulphureous and
γ ferreous Pyrites on the Shore of the Northern Sea,
that shewed no Sign whatever of Arsenick and Cop-
per, neither before nor after their Being changed to
Vitriol. They were composed of parallel F ibres al-
most like Wood, very sofr, and of a fine Brightness t
But they were covered with a coarse Sand some F eet
deep, which the Water of the Sea could penetrate
easily enough, and they had no Manner of Taste‚
and consequently were altogether void'of Vitriol.
But after they had been exposed to the Air for a '
Fortnight, they lost intirely their Brightnes8‚ and
were become so rich of Vitriol, that small green
Crystals of the Size of Millet-seeds appeared on their
Surface. Now if the Moisture alone was sufficient to

produce this Effect, there is no Reason, why they ”

should not have been resolved into Vitriol under a
very moist Sand. There remains still a wandering
foffile Acid‚ which fills also the aerial Region. Many
affirm, indeed, that this concurs to promote an abun·
dant Production of Vitriol, nor must we by any
Means exclude it intirely, no more than the Moist-
ure of the Air. But whoever serioussy considers
what has been said before concerning this, will own
that there are some Conditions requislte for the Pro·
duction of Vitriol, which we do not as yet clearly
understand. ν

Vitriol, and the other Species of fastitious Vitriols· ς
but we shall treat of these more at large on another
