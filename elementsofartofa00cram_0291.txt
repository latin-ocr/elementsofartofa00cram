Body remaining in the Mixture‚ commonly consti-

PROCESS XXIV.

‘T 0 determine the Quantity ⁰f the remaining Silver which
Aqua Fortis leaves in Gold.

H IS Process is not effentiaHy different from

Proc. XXII. and XXIII. N⁰. 2, except

that many Cautions must be taken, and a perfest

Knowledge of the Proportion of the Gold and Silver

which constitute the Mixture, is required in the
foregoing.

APPARATUS.

1. Take then of the purest Gold prepared accord-
ing to the foregoing Proc. ΝΟ. 2. or to the XXIs‘,
and altogether void of Silver, one docimastical Mark
divided into Caram, and divide this into two Parts
perfeffly equa] : Add to each of these Portions the
Triple‚ that is one Mari< and a half of the purest
Silver (Proc. XXIII. ΝΟ. 2. or XXII. XIX). How-
ever, that the Mass may not be too great, you may
take half a Mark instead of an whole one: Which
must also be understood of the Parts of the Mark.
Put every one separately into two Coppels well
heated. Makea strong Fioe, that they may be made
red-hot: Then with a Ladle pour upon thern one
Centner of granulated tried Lead, not containing any
ponderabie Qantity of Gold in it. When the Lead
has been consumed in a bright Fire‚ leave it still for
one or two Minutes : Thus you will prevent the re·
maining of even the smallest Qantity of Lead
(Proc. II. Uſs N⁰. 3). If both Regulus’s are equipon-
derous in the docimastical Balanee, the Operation
hitherto has succeeded right, which otherwise must
be repeated.

2. According to' these Rules, make small thin

Plates with an Anvil and Hammer, both perfefflg
moot
