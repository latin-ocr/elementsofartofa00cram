AssAY1NG METALS. 281

Ounce of Copper in the Mixture, nothing must be
added. Shut the Crucible close with a Tile, and
fill the Furnace up to the vei-y Brink of the Cruci·
ble, with pickt Coals of a middle Size‚ taking great
Care not to leave any Vacuity z Kindle these Coals
by throwing upon them burning Coals, that a Mass.
sufficiently Fluid may be melted by 3 middling Fire :
Try with an ison-Hook pretty thick, whether the
Fufion is perfeet: Then stir the melted Mass with
the same Hook not keeping it too long immersed,
because it would soon be consumed. This done,
have at Hand a precipitating Flux, composed of four
Parts of granulated Lead, ofglass·Gall, of common
Salt rnested, and of Litharge one Part each, to which
you may add one Part of Filings of Iron and of Cop-
per. Weigh as many half-Ounces of this Flux, as
there. are Marks of the granulated Gold, and with
an i1·0n-Spoon pour it thereupon at several Times,
that it may be equally distributed all over the Sur,
face of the melted Gramzla. After each Injestion,
stir the melted Mass with an iton-Hook 3 that all
the Things may be well mixt: Cover the Crucible
with 3 Tile, and leave it thus for a few Minutes‚ be-
fore you throw in another Portion. Mean while,
. you must here and there supply with fresh Coals the
Fuel that is consumed, taking great Care not to let it
be wanting in any Place, lest you should thus render
the Fire unequal‚ or lest the Fuel being too much di-
minished, you ssaould be obliged to add too much
Coals at one Time ε For, by that Meam, theVeffels,
especially the larger Ones, eafily contra& Chinks,
and spill the melted Matter.

4. After the Quantity mentioned of the precipi-
tating Flux has been put in, let the Matter remain
in the Fire for about halfa Qarter ofan Hour more :
Then pour it into a melting Cone, rubbed within
with Tallow‚ or, if the Qantity is too great, pout·
it into a warm iron-Mortar‚ covered over with a thin
Lute‚ and made very hot : Immediately after this,
put the Crucible again into the Furnace, and snr-
