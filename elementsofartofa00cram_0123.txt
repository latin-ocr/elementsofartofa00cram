AssAY1NG METAL'S} 105

Weight added on one Side ·, it ffiews, either that the
Axis is not sufficiently acute, or that the Holes of
the Fork in which the Axis turnS, being too nar-
row, refist to the Motion of it; or, in short, that
the Axis is placed too high above the horizontal
Line', drawnfrom one of the Rings of the Arms
to the other. The two first Faults are very
eafily mended, by either ssmrpening the Axis, or
widening the Hole. As to the third Defcch as
the Axis cannot be removed, the 'Rings must be
elevated: Which may he done in the Manner
mentioned (N0 1). 3. It is a Fault: in a Balance,
when being equipoised‚ it does not stand the inter·-
changing of the Powers 3 or if the Powers being re-
moved, it declines on either Side : This shews, when
the Scales and Dilhes are equiponderous, that either
one of the Arms of the Beam is shorter than the
other, or the one out-weighs the other, or that the
Dese& proceeds fron] both Causes. Therefooe, to
corre& it, you must first life up the Balance unload-
ed, and if it is not in equilibrio, let the Equipoise
be restored, by putting Grains of Lead into the
Scale. Then put the small Diss1es into the Smles,
and if the Bal-unce does not remain in equilibrio, let
the Equilz'brizcm be again restored, by putting granu-
lated Lead into the small Diffi, not into the Scale.
This done, if the Dishes can be interchanged, without
altering the quzilibrz'zmm it shews, that you must
take as much matter from one of the Scales, with a.
Whetstone or a File, as you have put Graius of Lead
in the other, to obtain an Equilz'brium .· For one is
heavier than the other: Which lnequality is most
commonly occafioned by Dirc, or Rust. Qut if you
cannot interchange your small Dishes, and preserve an
Equilibriztm‚ you may be sure that one or the other
of the Extremities of the Beam, and even that which
goes down after the interchanging of the Dilhes, is
more remote from the Axis than the other. Where-
fme, this Arm must be made shorter: Which is done,
by preffing softly, and a small Matter towards the

Axis,
