AssAmNG METALS. 49

cause the said Ores to mest, which are otherwise ren-'-

s (lered refractory by the calcareous and incombustible
Stones and Earths mixed with them : Which, how-
ever, is not so eafily ‘obtained with the said Scorioe, ag
by Means of the abovementioned Glass of ἰείη] and
Sall. But the great Price of these hinders their being
frequently used.

161. We have already said (ᾗ 51, 98, 133, and
137.) how useful these Sczlts (ξ 159, 160.) were, sor
t-he meltihg of Gold and Silver, and of their Calxs.
But when, in the Fufion itself, Gold and Sis'ver are to
be purged of other Met-als ancl Semi—Metals, then it
is proper to use Nitre only, or at most Nare together
with Other Salt's. For Semi-Metals‚ and the fons less
perfest Metals‚ are destroyed (ᾗ 13'7.) by Nitre 3 in
which Case Nitre, by its' Detonation with their Sul-
phars, is in part alkalized, ancl, by help ofa gentle
Five, turns the Calxs proceecling from these Metal&-
into a vltrious and much attenuated Scorict. ·

Coroll. Thence the Reason is plain, why G‘old and.
Silver' made brittle, are readily restored to their Mal-

'leahility by Nilre .· For Semi-Metals, and among
Metals Lead and Tin most of all, communicate this
Fault to Golcl and Silver .· But being changed by Nisre‘
in the Manner aforesaid (ᾗ 161.) they are in a fimple
Fufion again rejected by Gelai and Sil-ver: So that:
they can no longer mix with these lVletals, unless
some Reduffion is made. However, there is no other
Body that can, by mixing with Silver and Gold, render
them brittle‚ unless crude Charcoals happenlng to fall

’ into the Veffel whetein Golcl and Silver are nmlted,
should impregnate it with something arsenical ; there

being some Arstm'ck contained in Coals of this Kind,
as is demonstrated by Stalyl and Hqffinan.

162. The most imperfect Metals, and the Semi-
Metals melt more eafily, by addingSczlts (ξ 159, 160.)
to them, than they clo of themselves. However‚
they always lose a great deal of their Substance by
this meanS, which happens especially with regard to
Coppcr and Iron. To mend this, it is necessltry to
