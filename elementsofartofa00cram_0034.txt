to have lost a Trifle of their weight: Nor are they,
for all that, destroyed of that Qantity, for it may,
by a plain Separation, be extraffted again out of the
Litharge‚ and will then be found of the same Nature
as before: As the Operations in our second Part will
ffiew.

52. The melting of Semi-metals is also promoted
by a Mixture ofLitharge3 and then it happens with
them as with less perfect Metals: Which is facilitated
by an Addition of Iron.

53. Therefore it is self-evident of what great use
this Litharge is in roasting refracstory Ores of Gold,
Silver, and Copper. For it rnelts any Stones and
Earths whatsoever, with more swiftnes3‚ than it turns
Metals into Glass, provided every thing be equally
and minutely mix’d. Then the Metal which is hea-
vier goes down through the Glas3‚ which is in a thin
Fluxiom and gathers into a Regulus, upon which a
few small earthy Scorz'aeare swimming. But there is
always a Part of the Metal destroyed at the same
Time .· Or if it is Gold or Silver, a small Qantity
of it is detained in the Scoriae.

54. But as the Litharge penetrates through any
Veffels whatever, and, while meldng, rises into a
Scum, and thus easily overtlows3 Affayers never use
it alone, but communicate a Clamminess to it, and
fix it by adding a certain proportionable Qiantity of
Flints, Smd, Clay‚ &c. for they take of Powder of
calcined Flints‚ or of Sand one Part, of Litharge two
Parts, which they mix very exaffly by pounding
thern together3 to this they add Nitre or common
Sais, that the whole rnay melt more easily ·‚ they [hut
the Veffels, which must be thick and solid, with a
small Cover cut close, lest the Coals which are to re-
duce the Litharge into Lead, lhould fall into it, they
leave it thus melted for above a Qarter of an Hour
and more, during which Operation they must be ever
looking into the Affl-Hole of the Wind-Furnace, to
examine whether the Crucible holds the Glass or n0.
