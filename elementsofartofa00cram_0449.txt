your Stones thus prepared in a very clean Iron-mortar,
or upon a very hard Piece of Porphyry, to a subtile
Powtler.

2. Take four Parts of this Powder, as much of
Por-assi, or of some other alkaline fixt Salt well pu-
rified, and one Part of Cobalt well roasted, or of
eliquated Bismuth-ore‚ both likewise comminuted‚
and pound them together in a Mortar, that they may
be thoroughly mixt : Let them melt for a few Hours
in a well tried Crucible covered with a Tile, in a
most violent Fire having a Draught of Air. When
the Crucible is taken out of the Fire, cool it by
sprinkling it with Waoer, and then break it· : Exa-
mine the small Bits of Glass‚ whether they are opa-
que, osa very dari< blue and almost blackish Colour 3

the Colour is too light, and the larger Bits of Glass
almost transparent, you must add two or three
Times more of Caput Mortuum of Cobalt ‚ or of Bis·
muth ς substrac‘ting something, if the Colour proves
too dee .

pretty transparent, without any Colour, and already
made of Flints and Salt, it will be the same Thing :
But as this is refraetory not only of its own Nature,
but is also rendered such by the Cobalt, it is proper
to add moreover one third Part of Pot-ash with re-
spe& to the Cobalt.

1. This Earth which tinges Glafl‘es with a blue
Colour, has been found only in the Cobalt of Arsenick
and Bismuth, and it rnay be known ex tempore, if you
but melt it with two or three Times as much Borax,
on Account of the specifick blue Colour which it gives
to this Salt. It is not metallick: At least, Artificers have
not been able, by anyMethods hitherto-known, to ex-
tra& any Metal out of then& unless there remains {pero
