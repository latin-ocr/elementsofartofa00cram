12. Fill about one third, or one half Part of the
Beny, of a high, narrow glass-Cucurbite‚ not cut
off : Apply to this, instead of an Alemfflck, another
large inverted Cucurbite, cut off at Top, and stop
the Joints with Lute: Put it into a Sami—bath, in a
Situation somewhat oblique: Nor must you gather
your Sand around it, higher than the Mixture in the
Cucurbite : Then perform the Sublimation‚ in a Fire
somewhat gentler than Cinnabar requires : The arse-
nical white Flowers will adhere above, together with
neat white Crystals of Arsenick, or they will be
gwy, and the sublimed Cinnabar will be lower, nor
will this, however, be altogether void of Arse-

nick.

1. A great Qiantity of Sulphur melted with Arse-
nicl<‚ may be separated from it for the greatest Part,
by a gentle Sublimation (Proc. LXIX): But a Part
of the Sulphur is so strictly detained by the Arsenick,
that they can never ascend but both together3 in such
Manner however, that the first Sublimate and the
mowers are richer of Sulphur‚ while that which as-
cends last, contains little or no Sulphur at all ε But
this requires a gentle Fire ssowly increased.

2. A more perfect Separation of Sulphur and Arse·
niel< is obtained by Means of Mercury‚ and even at
first the Sulphur is joined to the Mercury the cold
way, by Trituration alone : Which we learn from the
Produstion of the AEthiops Mineral, which being af-
terwards sublimed by Fire‚ turns to Cinnabar‚ But
this Experiment will never succeed to your Satis-
faffion, unless the Trituration of the Arsenick with
the Mercury is very well performed : For else, when
the. Fire begins to aft, there ascend first ofall Flowers
of an &ange-colons, on Account of the mineral
Sulphur, which F lowers are more volatile than the
pure Arsenick that follows, and fill the upper—Part of
the Vesse13‚ spoiling the said Arsenick ⁴, because
