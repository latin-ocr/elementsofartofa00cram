ASSAYING METALS. 169

cause the Acid of Sulphur, to affiime the Form of
Vitriol together with the Metal 3 because no Sais can
exert its saline Virtue‚ unless it be dissolvet} by pise,
or by &Vateiz Befides, the crystalline form and
Transparency of Vitriols, can never be procured with-
out the Intervention of Water. But the vitriolick
Salts constitute many Waters‚ called on this Account
medicinal WaterS‚ as are the Pyrmoizt Waters‚ and
several others, Wherefore, you may also ex tempore
find out, whether such Waters contain Vitriol, by
pouring some Water upon a boiled rough Vegeta'ole,
for Instance upon Tea, Galls‚ the Herb Tormentil,
Snake-weed, &aa ,sor this Mixture turns immediately
into a black opaque Ink, if there is any Vitriol of
Iron mixt with it. But whether the Water contains
Vitriol of Copper‚ will appear, if after having put
pieces oflron into it, they are succeffively consumed,
and the Copper on the contrary precipitated, which
is of course. N21y‚ if there is a great Qantity of
Vitr‘iol of Copper inherent in the Writers, the Cop-
per, on this Account‚ being abundantly expelled by
the said Pieces of Iron, at last grows solid, and ap-
pears rongh and blistered on the Outfide, and seems
to confist within of a great Number of parallel
Filaments‚ and to be more easy to break in the Di-
rection of the said Filaments‚ being otherwise of a
duetil Nature.. Jn this Case, such precipitated Cop-

per is called by the Germans Φοεηῑεηῐςῗὶῑαρΐεϊς and
theWaters which are impregnatetl with an Abnntlance

of Vitriol of Copper, are called OEnemenff'fflaffet.
This occasions the Custom among the Germanis, of
calling all vitriolick VVaters by the Name of {Rupfetss
wl‘affcr33 though they contain a very great Qan-
tity ol Iron, and very little Copper.

420. Pure Vitriol is also found here and there in
the Mines, in a solid various Form. It is sometimes
congeaeled like VVater‘frozen, and is then called Vi-
triolzmz Stalafficzzm (§ 357), which is of a green Co-
ltmr, mixt more or less with blue, indicating the
Presence oftempered Copper. It is compatet, and is,
