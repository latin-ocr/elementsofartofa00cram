Third or Second, when they are already red-hot.

You must, before this Furnace is constructed,
make an Appar uus for leveral Operations: And thus
you will pe erform a gree t many Experiments, with
very little Trouble aiid Loss of Time ε So that Ι
can affore n.y Readers, that none have been more
agreeable to me than tliose I have made in this Fur-
nace, though they are extreamly tiresome by any
other Method, on Account of the strongest Fire
which must be continued so very long. 1 do not

Cement and Brick, in which I left two small Doors,

which the strongest Fire was to be applied, next to
the Hole which conveyed the Fire from the fise—Placet
that was in the Tower, into this Chamber: And
those which required a more gentle Fire, I placed
in the Middle, and over-against the foregoing: But,
as the Stones were not of the best Kind, and the Fire
continued for two Days together was most violent,
the Furnace was almost destroyed, and the Supports
of the Veffels almost immersed in the viti-ified Stones, ·
