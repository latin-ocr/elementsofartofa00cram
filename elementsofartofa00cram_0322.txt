2. Have at Hand a melting-Furnace, with a Bed
made of Lute and Dust of Charcoal in its bottom-
Part described (Part 1. ὗ 2 39, 240.); apply to this
at the Outfide, another Bed, (Ibid. Plate ΙΙΙ. Fig.
13. lett. i.) and join them with Luoe, that the Mat·
ter running out of the inferior Hole when open, may
be received into it3 surround this outward Bed both
with fresh and burning Coals, and fill the Furnace with
the same Fewel that it may be dried3 then with a
Pair of Bellows excite the F ire for a Qarter of an
Hour ; and then put the Ore into it at several Times;
nor will it be amiss to add to it some Scales ³¹* of 1-
ron. But you must put the Ore in such a Manner,
that it may be above the Coals‚ facing the Hole
through which the blast of the Bellows is admitted
into the Furnace: However let it not touch the
Walls of the F urnace 3 for it is cast upon the Side,
where the Hole has been said to be, the melted Ore

you must remove the Scoria with a Poker, to be in-
troduced through the oblong Aperture of the (Plat.

Time while the Ore is put into the Fire, the Fur-
nace must be filled, two thirds at least, with Coals
of a middling Bigness‚ and after each Portion of the
Ore is put in, add a larger of Coals above it.
