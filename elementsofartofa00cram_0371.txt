As for the rest, it has been found, that the Parts
of Animals, on Account of the Abundance of Oil
they contain, are of a quicker Effe& than the Rest.

2. Prepare an Earthen—veffel, the best Figure of
which is ‘the Cylindrical, two or three Inches higher
than the Iron-barrs ΝΟ. 1.) are long: Put into the Bot-
tom of it: your Cement: prepared in the aforesaid
Mamer, so that being gently preffed down, it may
cover the Bottom of the Veffel to the Height osone
Inch and a half. Place the Iron—bars perpendicu-
lady, in such Manner, that they may be about one
lnch distant frorn the Sides of the Vessci, and from
each other: Fill the-empty Interstices with the sanie
Cement·, and cover also the Bars with it, that the
Veffel may be quite fuist next cover it with a Tne,
and stop the Joints with thin Lute.

tain an equal Fire, ae either in the Bottom of the
Tower, or in the first Chamber of the Athanor
(Part Ι. § 243.) Make a Fire so strong, as that the
Veffel may be moderately red-hot for six or ten
Hours together: When this Time is over, take it
out of the Fire, and dip the red Iron—barrs into cold
Water. They will then be brittle, and turned to
Steel‚ there will appear no Scoria at the Out-fide, nor
will the Weight be diminished, if you have but rightly
made your Process according to the Regimen of the
Fire,

4. The Signs of the Iron's being changed into See-el
are, if being red-hot, and extinguished in cold VVa-
ter, it becomes very hard, not yielding to the Ham-
mer, brittle when more strongly hammered, and re-
fisting the hardest File: By which Qality it is dis·
tinguished from Iron rendered malleable‚ which in-
deed grows rigid when extinguiffied in Water‚ but
yet retainss a considerable Degree of Duffility in the
Cold, and may be extended in all Dimenfions with
the Hammer. However‚ Steel that is cooled softly‚

and by ssow DegreeS, may be filed-and extended wiih
