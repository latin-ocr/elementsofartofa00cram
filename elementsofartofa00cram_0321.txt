APPARATUS.

A K E of the roasted Ore two Centners beaten
into a subtil Powder‚ mix them with an equa}
Qantity of Glass—gall, the more exastly, the better ·,
add also something of Filings of Iron, unless the

XXXI.

The Uſse and Reasbns of the Proceſs.

Every thing is already clear from Proc. XXXI.
There is need here of a very exa& Comminution
and Mixture, that the Scorificati0n of the Stones
mix’d with the Ore, and of the unmetallick Earth
'may be performed with greater Ease, and that there
may be no Neceffity of promoting it with so strong
and so ¹long a Fire. On this Account also a great
Addition of the F luxeS, especialIy of &ass-gall, is
required, to facilitate the PrecipitatiOn of the redu-
ced Particles of Lead through the sufficiently attenua-
ted Scoria.

PROCESS XXXIV.

To reduce and precipitate Lead out of any of its Ores„
by Stratiflcation with Chat-conl. ’
