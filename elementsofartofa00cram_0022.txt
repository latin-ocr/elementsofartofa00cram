(0-0). This, if perfec'lly pure, must be white; it
grows sofr in the Fire, and then evaporates entirely
into a thick white Smoke, that has the unpleasant
sme!l of Garlick3 but when grown cold, it gathers
intoa solid, halftransparent‚· ponderous, white body.
It is not inflammable. When exposed to the Air‚ it
affurnes a small milk white Skin; it may be reduced
into a Regulus, very much like Andmony, and in-

Corollar. Some refer Arsenick to the Class of Sul-
phurs3 but very improperly‚ as it plainly appears
from the Comparison of its Characieristicks just men-

18. Salts are Bodies diffoluble in Water, melting
or volatilein the Fire, but not inflarnmable.

19. First osaIl, there are two kinds of pure and
naturai Salts among Minerals·‚ one neutral, the other
acid.

20. The neutral is of two Sorts3 the first is com-s
mon Salt (G), sirmia, which, if pure, is always of
the whitest Colour. It is semipellncid, dissolves in
pure Water‚ thickens in a gentle Fire‚ appears to
consist of several reffellated, cubical and hexaedral
Crystals, joined together in truncated Pyramid33 it
crackles very lond, when thrown into the Fire.

21. The other is called Nitre ((1)), which when dis-
solved in pure VVater, and crystalhzed, according [ο.
Art, afl'umes a prismatical hexa'e’dral Figure, termi-
nated by small pyramidical Columns ofthe same Num-
ber of Angles. It is white, and nearly transparenr.
In a pure Fir-e, such as the Rays of the Sun collected,
or in Veffels defended from any Fuel falling into them,
it grows liquid by a gentle Heat: In a great Fire, it
partly perspires through the Veffels‚ and partly resolves
into a Smoke‚ which is the Nitre itself3 but any in-
fiammable Body being added to it, it burris with a ve-
