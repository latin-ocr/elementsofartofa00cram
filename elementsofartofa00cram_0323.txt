ASSAY1NG METALS. 297

3. When all the Ore is put into the Fire‚ conti-
nue to blow till the Fire is consumed in the Furnace.
Pour Water upon the foremost-Bed‚ Drop by Drop‚
to cool the Lead gathered in it. Look also into the
Scorias, tq see whether there are any Grains of Lead
dispersed among them 3 if you find it to be s0‚ beat
the ScoriaS, and walh the smallest Particles off with
Water, that you may have the Lead separate. F i-
nally‚ weigh this intirely: and the Weight will an·
swer to that which the Smelter will at last have.

The Ust’ and Reasons of the Process,

1. The Lead is reduced in this Process by its im..
mediate Conta& with the Coals; that is, the 0in
Part of the latter being agitated by a great Fire‚
and intirely extorted, penetrates the small vitrescent
metallick Particles‚ which being open by the Violence
of the Fire run down through the Interstices of the
burning Coals, which, in the foregoing Proceffe3‚
was effected by the black Flux in close VeffeIS.

2· But this Method is preferable to the foregofflg,
except that the Apparatus is attended with greater
Trouble. For when the Reduffion is finilhed, the
Lead conec'ted in the Bed of the bottom Part, runs
thence into the outward or foremost Bed ε there it is
preserved by a much gentler Hem, under the burn-
ing Coals that supply it perpetually with a Phlogi-
ston, and leaves its remaining Impurity. But take
Care in this operation, if you have a mind to make
your Experiment with many common Pounds
Weight, not to put too much at a Time to be re-
duced3 for, if you do this, you will not make a suf-
ficient Redustion, and the Fire is in some Measure
suffocated. Nor must you put the roasted Ore into
the Fire, before the Furnace and the Beds are well
dried and made red hot on the Infide3 for in this
Case you will find Grains of Lead dispersed among
the Scoria'S. The same uses to happen, if the Ore
is melted crude, or at least not sufficiently roasted:
for, the Sulphur which adheres in great Quantity to

the Lead-ore, is hardly diffipated, and not separati'gilg
