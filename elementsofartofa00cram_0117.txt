Ρ) 258. When small Pieces of Metal are to be melt-
ed ·‚ the bestWay todo it, is to put them upon ahard
Piece of Charcoal, with a small Hollow made in it ς
and then dire& the Flame ofa Lamp having a large
Cotton, upon the small Mass of Metal to be mehed,
by blowing it thereon with a small crooked Pipe:
For by this Mearm, Iron itself may be melted without:
any Apparatus: Which succeeds still better, by ad-
ding Boraxi Let the Pipe with which this is per-
formed, be made of Copper, and let it have in its
bending Part, a hollow Glo'oe one Inch in Diameter‚
'through which the Wind is to pass, that the Mois-
ture of the Breath gathering into small Drops may
be collected within the Cavity of this Globe, and not:
reach the small F lame, and hinder the Αᾶὶοη of the
F ire. Let the less Aperture of this Tube through
which the Wind comes out, be so small, as to admit:
hardly the smallest Needle. This is called the ce-
menting Tube, or Blow-pipe.

259. The Load-Stone is often sufficient to discover
Iron z For want of this Stone, you must have Recourse
for that Purpose, to a long and tedioos Apparatus.
Therefme, the Affayer ought to be provided of one
well armed, and keep it loaded in a dry Place.

260. You must likewise be provided of an Anvil‚
the upper Surface of which must be perfeffly well
polffhed, and about one Inch square, with a small
Hammer adapted to it : Both these must always be
kept perfeclzly clean, lest they should be spoiled by
Rust and Birt, and contra& Furrows : Otherwise, if
the Metal is vitiated‚ or any thing goes from it, it
hinders many OperationS, especially that Separation
of Golcl from Silwr, which is called Qtartati0n‚ and.
ss1all be explained in our pra&ical Part.
