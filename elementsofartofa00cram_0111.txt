Segment‚ ten or more Inches long: By means of
which the Heat and the boiling Vapours coming forth
are gradually diminished ·, lest the Recipient‚ which
is always chosen a Glass Veffel, should split. The
Recipient‚ which must be united with the other Ori-
fice of the said Segment, is supported either by the
Pavement‚ or by a certain kind of Trivet, the Con-
struffion of which is such, that it may be set lower or
higher by means of three Screws. 3. In this same
Chamber, instead of Distillations‚ you may also make
Cernentations‚ Calcinations, &a In which Case the

half above the iron-Ring (x x), wherewith this Pot is
surrounded, may be received within the Mouth of the
Cavity, and so that the Segnient cut in the Pot (y)
