it in so⁸me of them, than in others. But we reckon
those that contain less Iron in them, to be naturally
more fufible than the rest. Such are,

· 363. The vitreous copper-Ore (in German §Rupfep '
αόῑειῐεςῦξείξ). This is ol a darkish violet sky-Colour,
like that of a Piece of Steel that has touched a red
hot Iron. Befides‚ this Colour is commonly inter-
rupted here and there by Spots and grey VeinS. It
is very ponderous‚ and of a middle HardnesS. One
hundred Pound Weight of it, contains from fifty to
eighty Pound Weight of Copper3

364. The azure copper- -‚Ore is ofa most beautiful
blue Colour; it is soft, not very heavy, broken,
ssiining like blue Glass· ·, of all the copper— Ores it is
the most free from Iron, Affinick, and Sulphur,
though it exhales a little of the latter in the Ustula-
tion: wherefore, agreat Qantity of excellent Copper,
>is extraestd out of it with very great Ease.

365. The green copper-Ore is like green Crystals‚
often very neatly striated : it looks almost like a Ger-
mination *. As for the rest, this Ore has the Pro-
perties of the (ᾖ 364.) foregoing.

366. The light, dusty, blew Concretes‚ Coeruleum
Μοηίαηιιυι, in German fllssctgblau‚ and the green ones,
viride montanum, less properly Goffl-soffler, in German
fflb‘etgzgtun, being also called both by the Name of

and Weight of them. But the lighter ones are mixt
with unmetallick Earths: those that are yellow con-
tain iron-Oker: on which Account they are more
difficult to be melted, and yield less Copper‚ and ofan
inferior GoodnesS. This Mountain-blue‚ and the green
are carried here and there by WaterS, and apply
themselves to the Outfide of Lumps, like a Paint.

* Some of this copper-Ore germinates like the ssloffoms of Iron

(ξ 358), looks like white Coral tinged of a bluish green Colour,
aud may as properly be called Flores Cupri, or Bloffoms of Copper.
