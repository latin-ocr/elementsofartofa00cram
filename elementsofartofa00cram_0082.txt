⁷ 66 The ART of

of the spheroidal Mould towards the Border33 and
thus a Muffel is made with no great Trouble.

202. You see the Figure of the m‘eltz'mg Pots and
Crucibles (Plat. II. Fzg. V. and VI). These Vessels,
when small, are made with a Basis a little wider ;
both that they may not be thrown down, upon what
they are set on, by vthe Coals put upon them, and lest
they should fall, when taken out of the Fire, and
put upon a Pavement not exaftly horizon'tal.

203. These Veffels (ξ 202.) are formed in wooden
or brass Moulds divided into two PartS, from Top
to Bottom, that they may be disjoined and put toge-
ther again. For this Reas0n‚ they adapt a broad
iron-Riug‚ to the outfide of the Mould in such a
Mamer, that the two Parts of the Mould may be
joined close together, by applying the Ring to them,
and separated, by taking it away: Which appears
better from (Plat. ΙΙ. Fzg. VII. and IX) than from
the Description. However, this concave Model pro-
cures you only the external Forrn of the Veffel‚ but
the inward Cavity is made with a Pestle (Plat. II.
Fzg. VIII).

204. The Matter these Vessels (ᾗ 202.) are made
of, may be the same as that of the Tests and Muffels
(ξ 188 to 190). Observe only, that it is proper to
make use of the like Veffels, which have already sus-
tained a great Fire, and are very clean, reduced into
Powder² to correft the Stiffness of the Clay.

205. To make Veffels (ξ 202.) with this Appara-
tus (ᾧ 203), put your hollow Mould within the Iron
Ring (Fig. Vll. and IX), and lay it upon a firm
Support : Then fill the Cavity of the Mould, with a
sufficient Qantity of Matter (ᾗ 204.) very stiff;
which Quantity can hardly be determined‚ otherwise
than by Experience : Then pressit down with your
Fingers‚ o'r with a wooden-Stiek, leaving an hollow
in the Middle ς so that the Matter may rise a little
beyond the Sides of the hollow Mould: Finally,
put into it the Pestle (Eg. VIII.) rubbed over with
Bacon, and drive it down with several strong Strokes
