will the Operation proceed without Copper.

2. The Calcination of Tin is more speedily per-
formed, if you put into the Test half a Centner of
Tin upon twelve Centners of Lead‚ and lay it on the
fore-Part of the Muffel that is less hot: For then the
Tin will be perfeffly calcined in a few Minutes,
T hen take out the Veffels ; let them grow cold, that
the Ashes may be colleeted ; mixt thern with Glass
of Lead, and finally, scorify them upon the same Lead
and in the same Test‚ as b'efore (N0 1.)

T he ,Ust' and Reastms eff the Process.

1. The first Method by which the Scorification is
performed with Copper‚ is more speedy than the
'foregoing: But, on account of the Copper added,
yon must not only add an enormous Quantity ofLead‚
‘because Copper requires sixteen Times the Qantity
of Lead to be destroyed (see the fixth process), but ·
you must befides examine also separately in a Coppel,
whether the Copper contains any Silver. The two
last Methods are cleverer3 but they can hardly be
perse-&ly executed in two Hours: Because the Scoria
of Tin, without adding Copper to it, is with great
Difficulty brought to the same Degree of Perfeftion,
με when Copper is added,
