turn to Scoiia. The Ore being thus run down into
the inward Bed, must be sti rred now and then with
a Poker‚ that the small interspersed Grains of Bis-
muth may be driven out, and run into the outward
Besi, where they join with the Rest int 0 a Regulus.
When the senii· Metal is mel t‚ed tal< e away the
DrosS, with aSort of wooden Scraper or Houg h· And
reinoving the Body of the Furnace, take the Ore re-
maining in the inward Beel, and extinguish it in a
Vefl'el full of Water‚ and then warh off and rejeel:
the smallest Particles‚ colleeling only the larger Ones,
’ to melt them together in a gentle Fire.

3. You may also run down Bismuth in an earthen
or an iron·Veffel. Fill this with your Ore broken
in small Pieces, and make a wood-Fire all round:
And thus you will, by the same Method as before,
easily obtain Bisniuth out ofa fufible Ore, especially
out of a rich one.

4. You may also beat your Ore to a very fine
Powder‚ with the black Flux, glast-Gall, and corn-
mon Salt‚ in a close VeffeI, like the Ore of Lead or
of Tin, and melt it in 1 middling Fire, having a
Draught of Air: But, as this semi· Metal is de-
struftible and volatile, you must, as quick as pos-
sible, apply to it th itDecrree of Fire which the Flux
requires to be nielted, ando so soon as it is well mested,
the Vessel rnust be taken out of the Fire, and when
it is grown quite cold, and broken, you will find

your Regulus.

1. Bismuth is found in its Matrix’s, either pure
and in a semi—metallick Form, or in a State of Ore,
when Arsenick is joined to it: And as this semi-
Metal is at the same Time most fusible·‚ on this
Account, it does not want the Assistance of any
melting Menstruum, or of any redueing Phlogiston‚ ·
but may be run down out of its Ore, boy only0 a fim-

ple F usion and with a gentle Fire. If there 1} anll
