Veffels, and come to the Operations them-
selves, it is proper for us to shew the Nature of those
Bodies, Which are to be contained in these Vefl‘els‚
direfted and applied by these Instruments, and which
shall a& upon the Objeffit of Affaying.

37. Those Bodies, which being applied to others
according to certain Rules, dissolve them so as to ad-

of the Body diffolved, and cannot separate from them
again of their own accord, are called Menstrua. These
are chiefly divided into dry, and mozst 3 which last are
again subdivided many ways: But this being mention-
ed in all the VVritings of the Chemists, we shall pass
it by in Silence‚ as we only treat of one Part of Che-
mistry: For we need only to explain in a special Man-
ner, the Operations belonging to our present Pur-

pose, and to acquaint the Reader with the Prepara-
