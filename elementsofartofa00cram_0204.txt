son disposes to the same Attenuation the other Bodies
to be reduced into so subtile a Scoria.

456. There are EarthS‚ which turn into Metal,
by being intimately joined with an inflammable Prin—
ciple: As Metals destroyed, and changed into Scoria.
or Ashes, are, by their Union with the same Matter‚
again restored to their metallick F orm. This Ope-
ration is called ReduHion.

457. All Metals and semi-Metals may be reduced
by this Method (ᾗ 456), except Zink ·, which being
burnt to Ashes admits of no Reduc‘tion. However‚
the Mixture of Gold and Silver was never radically
dissolved by any Experiment hitherto known ;
wherefore‚ both these Metals need not be reduced by
the Addition (ᾗ 45 6.) of Phlogiston.

Coroll. Therefore‚ we must upon no Account refer
to this ClasS‚ that Reduetion by which the foreign
Bodics‚ which do but conceal the metallick Form,
are taken away. For Instance, Sulphur, Arsenick,
SaltS, ζέε.

458. The Observations to bc made concerning
Amalgamation, are already clearly hinted (ξ 65-68),
by what was said, when we treated of Mercury con·
sidered as a Menstruum.

459. When you are to join to a solid fixt Body‚ by
Vapour, another that is volatile, the Vapours must
be confined, lest they ffiould be too easily diffipated
in the Air-, and the Body itself which is to be pene·
trated, must be so placed, that the Vapours very
much agitated by the Fire, may as it were continu-
ally lick it *. The Manner of producing thern has
been already (ᾗ 153.) explained, when we spoke of
the menstrual Acids‚ which are to be applied in this
Manner to Bodies, especially to Metals. Therefore‚
as these Things are very strictly joined to our Sub-
jest, they must of Course be repeated. But as they
most commonly, in this operation, lay first one Stra-³
tum of the diffolving Menstruum, reduced into Pow-
