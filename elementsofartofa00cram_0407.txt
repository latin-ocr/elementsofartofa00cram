Ores ·, for so soon as they melt, the Exhalation of the
Sulphur is in closeVessels almost intirely stopt. Never-
theless‚ this Inconvenience may be remedied in some
Measure, by interposmg some refractory Body, that
exhales no Sulphur in the Fire, though it must not
·absorb or corrupt the Sulphur itself3 such is pure
Sand washed clean, and of the Nature of the Stone
called Qartz‘. But you must avoid all Stones of the
lime, chalk‚ or spaad-Kind.

2. When the Retort has been middling red-hot for
an Hour or more, let the Vessels grow cold: All the
Sulphur cooled by theWater‚ will adhere to the Ex-

‘The UJe and Redsons of the Process.

1. As there are in Minerals many volatil Matters
besides Sulphur3 it is easy to conceive, that it is not
always got pure out of them, but often joined with
other volatil Substances‚ that taint it 3 which may be
judged with some probability, from its Colour: For
'pure sublimed Sulphur is always of a fine Yellow
somewhat deeper than the Citron-colour3 but, its be-
ing of a red Dye shews that Arsenick has been su-
· blimed along with it: But, though Mercury,when sub-
limed with Sulphur, does likewise give it a reddiss1
Colour, it seldom mixes with it. However, if this
should be the Case, you may easlly distinguish it
from the striated Figure of the broken Sublimate‚
from its great Weight, and from the Place to which
it has applied itself during the Sublimation3 for,
where Cinnabar applies itself, there can remain no
Sulphur, nor any Arsenick.

2. By this Distillation‚ a most considerable Qan—
tity of Sulphur may be got out of the Pyrites 3 but

there remains a very small Qantity of the rnetglliclj1
