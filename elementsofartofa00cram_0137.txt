And so on, as in the foregoing.

297. If in the Table just mentioned (ξ 296), you
take pure Copper‚ instead of pure Silver, and Silver
instead of Copper·‚ this gives you a third Series of
golden NeedleS. And you will have a fourth, by
mixing with Gold equal Qantities of Silver and
Copper, in the same Proportions mentioned (ᾧ 296).

plain, that Work imen may easily employ an infinite
Number ofother Variations· ; which being compared
with those above-mentioned, may be distinguished in
a thousand different Ways, by an experienced Man ;
So that it is neither poffible, nor neceffary, to imitate
them all.

299 But lest the golden- Needles (§ 295 and foll.)
should be too expenfive‚ they may be made much
shorter than the Silver ones (ᾗ 289, 290), and be sol-
dered to Plates of Copper; that th ey may be suffici-
ently long for Use.

that you may see the true Colour of i-t: for from this
you may, in a. Manner, judge before-hand, what
Metal it is, and how much, or with what other Me-
tal it is mixt. Then chuse a convenient and not over
large Part of the Sursaee of your Metal, and at several
Times rub it: strongly against the Load stone that,
in case a deceitful Crust should have been laid upon
