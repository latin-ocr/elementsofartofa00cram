red-h0t3 and then increase it as much as is required
for a perfect Fufion of the Silver and Salt. The Fu-
sion being obtained, take out the Crucible‚ that the
whole may cool of itself; or pour it into an Ingot 3
the Silver shall be reduced perseffly pure out of this

&galf this filver-Calx (ΝΟ. ι.) is exposed alone to

the Fire‚ it melts so soon as it grows red 3 and if you
then increase the Fire a little more, it vanishesin Fume ;
when poured out quickly it appears a Body ofalight
scarlet Colonr, half-transparent, ponderous enough,
and so tenacioris, that it is difficult to reduce it to
Powder‚ and if you break it, it seems to be of a fibrous
Texture within : Whence it is called Lunae Cornua,
on account of its resembling the Horns of Animals

on the Outfide.

The Use and Reasons of the Proceſs.

1. Silver is not to be diffolved the moist Way in
Aqua Regis and Spirit of Salt; on the contrary, when
it is already diffolved· in *Aqua Fortis, you precipitate
it thence with Spirit of Salt: But so soon as this is
done, a Solution of the Silver by the Acid of Aqua
Regis happens in the dry Way : For a considerable
Qantity of Aqua Regis is joined to the Calx of Silver
precipitated to the Bottom ·‚ whence its Volatility
depends. For this Reason likewise, if you mix a.
little of Spirit of Salt to Spirit of Nitre‚ you eafily

“ obtain the Separation of the former from the latter

 

by Silver. See Part I. § 122. But the Copper
whereof any small Qantity remains mixt with the
Sssver, in the Operation of coppelling, is not: to be
precipitated by Spirit of Salt ε Therefore, when the
other Metals are consumed in the Coppel, the metal-
lick Part of this Calx is perse& and pure Silver.
Gold itself is also perfestly separated in the same
Mamer, if the Aqua Fortis is not quite saturated by
the Silver„ ¹
