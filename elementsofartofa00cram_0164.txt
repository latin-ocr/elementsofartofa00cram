derable Qantity of Arswick, they then look pale,
like the sulphureous Copper (§ 316.) Pyrites·, and
even are whiter than this, according as the Qantity
of the Arsenick is greater. Nevertheless, they, even
in this Case, are distinguished from the iron-Pyrites,
because they are more ponderous, and give not
Sparkles so eafily, ifeven they give any, when struck
with a Steel: which every iron- Pyrites (ὃ 316, 323),
ancl any solid iron— Ore will do.

3.7o The Reasons why the copper Ores above-
mentioned (ᾗ 363—369) are rendered refra&ory‚
and even entirely unfufible, are explained (§ 336).

371· The yellow sulphureous i1·on-Pyrites(§ 316.)
belongs likewil‘e to this mass, though improperly.
For it often contains in it a Qantity of Copper‚
not to be despised‚ but it is looked upon as improper
to Copper‚ and as very rel'raclory‚ on account of its

great Qantity of Iron In the mean Time you find
out whetl her lt contains Copper ·‚ 1. From its not be-
in g ol a globulrr Figure: for 1t is evident from the
0³21e1-v-2i1t0ns of Ησιῠιέιί, that globular Pyrites are
altog [hei destiru tc of Copper. 2. From its unusual
*Lscllown 1s,1preading through the whole Substance
of ir

Co dl. From the above-mentioned (ς 369, 371.)
ParthulatrQ we may easily deduce some Rules, where-
by τρε ssnll be able pofitively‘to affirm, that a Pyrites
contains Copper in it. For Instance, let this be a
Rule z The gold greenifh Colour of ιι Pyrites is ιι Szgn
os its containing a great Quantity of Copper. · which is
confirmed by Experience. But you cannot by any
M ans in vert this Rule thus: ff ιι Pyrites contains ιι
grew Ouzmity of Copper, it is of ιι gold greenifh Colour. ·
be cmse w hen Arse nick is mixt with a Pyrites, even
one that is very rich of Copper, it makes 11: entirely
10οξ pale (ξ 369). The same may be said of every
suc Rule. ,
