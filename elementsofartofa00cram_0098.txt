, 80 The ART of

v25. A perfect Management of the F ire is most
concnonly necessary, in the performing of Operations
’ in this ,Furnace (§ 232, 233) : Therefore, the Reader
must ¹give Attention to what follows. If the Door of
the Affi-hole (Plat. ΙΙΙ. Ρῑζξ. Ι. e) is quite open;
and the Sliders of the upper Door (f) drawn towards
each other, so as to touch one another in the Middle
of the Door3 and if besides the Cover (q) and the
Fimnel (t) adapted to its Tube (r) is upon the Top
(d) of the Furnace, the Fire will then be in the high-
.est Degree poffible: Though in the mean Time it
is hardly ever neceffary to put the Funnel on, except
in a very cold Season. But if, after having disposed
the Furnace in the Manner just described, you put
red burning Coals into the open upper Door (f) of it,
the Fire is still more increased thereby: However,
this Artifice is never, or very seldom, neceffary. When
you shut the upper Door, with only that Slider, that
has a narrow oblong Hole in it (Plat. 111. Fzg. Lm)
then the Heat becomes a little less : But it diminishes
still more, when you shut the Door with the other
Slidcr, that has in it the Semi-circular Hole (n), which
is larger than that of the first Slider : Nay, the Heat
again is lesS, when you take away the Funnel put at
top of the Cover: Finally, the Door of the Ash-hole
being either in part or totally ffiut, the Heat is still
diminilhed, because the Draught of Air, so necessary
to excite the Fire, is thereby hindered. Butif, be-
fides all these, you likewise open the upper Door
quite ·, then the cold Air rushing into the Muffel,
cools the Bodies put under it, that are to be changed,
to a Degree never required in any Operation, and
such as will entirely hinder the boiling of Lead. If
during the Operation, the F ire begins to decay, or to

of the Muffel : Therefore, in this Case, you must stir
your Coals on every Side, with an Iron Rod, which

is to be introduced through the upper Hole (p) εἰ
