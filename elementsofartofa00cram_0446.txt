420 The ART of

OF COMMON SALT.

PROCESS LXXVII.

To try saline W'czters.

APPARATUS.

A L-gem may be extracted simply out of Earths

and Stones with warin Water. But saline Waters
must be purified, by either Filtration, or Rest. Let
several Pints of them be inspiffated by a strong Boil-
ing, till a thin Pellicle, or small Crystals appear on
the Surface of the Liquor. Next, the Fire must be
diminished‚ that the saline Erine may be only mid-
dling warni, and smonk : The Crystals which were
small at first, will grow of a linger Size ε They
are of the Figure of a hollow, truncated Pymrnid,
open at the Bisa, made of a Heap of small CubeS,
which being become large at last smk to the Bottom
of the Solution. But, ifyou use a stronger Fire, the
whole Surface of the Brine will be covered with an un-
formed saline Crust, which, hinders all further Ex-
halation, unless you break and precipitate it to the
Bottom. When it is so far inspissated‚ as that the sa-
line Crystals may be almost even with its upper Sur-

lace3 you must decant the Brinef rom the subfiding ,

Crystals, and this must be inspissated in the same
Manner: The Crystals of Salt being collected, and
‹lried by a gentle Heat‚ must at last be weighed.

The Use and Reasons of the Proccss.

You may plainly see from these Processes‚ how
common salt may be separated from other Salts
eafily turning to Crysta13‚ and chiefly from Nitre.v
For some Salts are difficultly and in small Qantity

diffolved
