268 The ART of

in vain, when an Error has been committed in the
Beginning. Nor do you lose your Labour or Time,
if after having made small Plates with the Mixture,
you examine again the said Plates rolled up in a Pair
of Scales : For then you not only are certain whether
you have committed any Error ·, but you at the same
Time dete& the Cause of it.

3. Take Care that your Aqua Fortis be not too
much concentrated, and that the Diffolution be not,
made rnore impetuous than is proper, by an exceffive
Heat, especially in the Beginning τ For by so doing
it happens, that the Aqua Fortis which corrodes the
Silver out of the Interstices of the small Plates‚ dis-
joins the Particles of the Gold by its elastick Effer-
vescence, whence it is easy to lose Part of it. Like-
wise every moist Body, resolved into Fumes with
great Hurry, may secretly carry away along with it
Part of the inherent Body: Which is chiefly true
with Regard to acid Spirits. Thence it is plain,
that Silver mixt with Gold in much greater Quan-
tity, may be corroded by Aqua Fortis, and at the
same Time preserve the Figure which the Gold had

before, if you know what properStrength Aqua Fortis
ought to have.

APPARATUS.

1. Ccording to the carat-Mark in little (Proc.
XXIV. ΝΟ. 1.) weigh of the Gold .to be

tried one half Mark 3 and after having found the
Allay of it by proper Needles, put it into a Coppel
with a sufficient Qantity (Proc. VIII. N⁰. 1.) of
lead ε That the Copper mixt with it may be con-
sumed. If you have made the Coppelling in the End,
with a Fire strong enough to diffipate all the Lead ;
