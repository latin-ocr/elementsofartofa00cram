which are perpetually produced by the Lead, being
cast upon the Border, will be immediately absorbed·
by the Coppel‚ which, on this Account, will be
tinged with a yellow‚ brown, black Colour, in pro-
portion as the Scoria shall have penetrated into it.

2. But so soon as you see the Regulus boil with
Violence and Smoke‚ diminish the Fire a little ; that
the Regulus may for the greatest Part be consumed
by a middling Heat. You will know that the De-
gree of the Fire is very great, if the Smoke proceed-
ing from the Lead‚ is driven up almost to the very
Cieling of the Muffeh and if the Regulus in the Cop-
pel is gibbous at Top: In which, however, the
Qantity of the Metal is to be considered: For a
large Mass of Regulus makes the spherica] Segrnent
low, and a lesser one makes it more acute, when the
same Degree of Fire has been used for each of them.
Then‚ if the Coppels are so bright with the Fire,
as that it be hardly poffible to distinguilh how far the
Scoria has entered, it is a Sign ofa still greater De-
gree of the Fire. But you will know that the Degree
of the Fire is middliug, if the Surface of the melted
Metal is plain, if the Smoke does not rife very
high, and if the Coppel is coloured by the Scoria's,
which Sigus indicare that the Fire wants a Degree of ’
Force. But ifthe Smoke wanders to and fro on the
Surface of the Metal ·‚ ifthis is almost flat, and the
Ehullition of the Scoria's‚ which are like Drops of
Fue, is but weak, and their Motion languid, if in
lhort the Coppels appear dark‚ it is a Sign that the
Fire has not its sufficient Degree of Strength.

‚If you see the Regulus confiderably ”diminishess
the3 Fire must still be increased: The Ι ead being
thus considerably diminished‚ the bright Spar rkles
will disappear, and instead of them, you will see
Im's’ s, as it were, muchlivelier than m the Beginning
and the Middle of the Operation, quickly moving
on the Surface of the Regulus, and croffing each
other many different WayS. When at last all the

Lead is consumed, the tendes Skin of the thin Scoria
