⁸222 The ART of

saturate the Metal that lies hidden in thern.- For
which Reason‚ this superfluous Sulphur diffipates in
a middling Fire z But ifit had been mixt with Lead,
it would have rendered it refra6³tory3 nor could it
afterwards be diffipated from it* (Part Ι. § 142.)
without a considerable Destruftion of the Lead. The
white arsenical pyrites, turn also a great Quantity
of Lead into Glass, on account of the Abundance of
the Arsenick they contain. For which Reason‚ these
Ores must be previoussy roasted‚ that the Sulphur
and Arsenick may be diffipated : Nor need you sear,
lest any Part of the Silver be carried away by the
Arsenick ε’ For when Arsenick is separated from any
fixt Body‚ by a certain Degree of Fire ; it> carries
nothing of that Body away with it (Part I. ᾗ 74,
2 .)

3 Ξ, Every Pyrites has Iron for its Basis : But this is
not only refraROEy of its own Nature, but has much
ado to melt into a thin Scoria‚ even with the Glass
of Lead.

3. Near a—Kind to these is an unmetallick Earth‚
annexed in great Plenty (Part I. ᾗ 316, 323.) to
every Pyrites. Therefore, after the Sulphur and Ar-

, senick are diffipated‚ the only Thing remaining to
be done, is, to use the Methods we have described
in the third ProcesS.

PROCESS V.

Precipitation of Silver out of Iron, by Scorzfication.

A P P A R A T U S.
1. PUT one Centner of Iron reduced to Fillings,

or to thiu Lamina's, into a glass Cucurbite
cut off in the Middle‚ the Belly of which must be
luted over3 then pour upon it as much Oil of Vitriol,
diluted in about eight Times the same Qantity of
*Waten as is required for the Diffolution of Iron:

Put the Cucurbite again upon the Ashes or a w‘agrg
