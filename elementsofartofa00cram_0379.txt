other Mineral, especially Sulphur, be in the Case·
; For the latter may be mixt with Mercury bya bare
I rituration, or even by Heat‚ and with it makes a

1 1111161 Powder called ‘The AEthiops Minerczl, which

being agitated by a strong Fire in a high, nar

and produces that Kind of Cinnabar, which 1s called
fa Siliam Cinmtbm·³ beci ise lt is quite 111 e that native
Ore of Mercury which goes by this Name (Pcml.

’ ᾗ 11οᾋ2 ) As for the rest? you must use 111 11113 Dis

tillation the same Precatitions as in Proc. XVIII,
where a Process almost like this is described: Nay
this may even be performed with the same Apparatus
if you have it at Hand.

2. We reject here the Distillation by Ascent3 be-
cause Mercury can hardly be forced up so high,
without some Danger of the Veffel’s being cracked:
Belides, it is in this Case difficultly collected, and
Part of it easily steals away, on Account of the too
great JointS. It succeeds indeed better by Descent:
Nevertheless‚ even ¹then some Part of the Mercury
either hides itself in the rough Surface of these Veffels,
or penetrates through the Veffel itself: because the
latter contracts Chinks pretty often, on Account of the
moist aqueous Vapours that make damp the upperVes-
sel Therefore‚ an Iron Vefl‘el, if you have any, is pre-
ferable: For then, when the Joints are well stopt,
you obtain the saine Qantity of Mercury‚ as if 11
was expelled laterally.

3. In every Process to be made by Fire with Mera
cury, the mercurial Vapour is to be avoided by all
Means: For breathing too much of it causes a Sali-
vation; and breathing little and frequently of it causes
¹ Tremblings, Asthma's, Palfies, and finally Con-2
sumptions: Nay, it is also hurtful to forne, if but ma-
naged with naked and chiefly sweating HandS. ,
