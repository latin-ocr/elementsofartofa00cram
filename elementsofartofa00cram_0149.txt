ASSAYING METALS. 13¹

Gl'ass the azure colom, as the other true Cobalts do.
On which Account it is true (Σοίηῑίί, though outward-
ly it seems to differ very much from the common Sort
(§ 325). It has indeed Colmlt (ξ 325), for its Base,
and seems to be produced by it, by a Germination as
it were like that of Plumose Allum.

327. These (ᾗ 325, 326.) are the principa} Spe⁵
cies of true (Iob-alt, which all agree in this Point, that
they have a very great Qantity ofArsenick in them z
wherefore they are here referred to the Class, of arse-
nical Miuemls, though they sometimes have that·
Difference from other atsenieal Rodia, that after the
Sublimation of the Arsenick, they leave a Caput M'or-
tzmm, which tinges white Glass of an azure Colour.
There are likewise many other Miner-als, which they
commonly ca'll Cobalt. But as they are totally dif-
ferent from the true Cobalt‚ and even do not con-
tain the least Sign of Arse—niel< ·, for this Reason, and
to avoid Confufion, they deserve to be expelled out
of the Class of Cobalt.

328. NeverthelesS, there is a certain Minerzss, that
deserves to be referred to this Class: it is rich in Arse—
nick, somewhat like Cobalt (§ 325), ofa grey reddiss1
Colour, it looks like a Semi-meta} ·, it contains also
a little Copper, and a little Sulphur3 the Germans call
it Kupfer Nickel.

329. There are also a great many other NIinerals‚
which,0n account of theArsenick contained in them, are
likewise referred to this ClasS. But as there is in them
a greaterQantity of Metal than of Arsenick ·‚ for this
Reason, they shall here-after be teckoned among other
Claffes, as being improper (ᾗ 311.) to Arsenick. I
shall only add, that Arsenick makes itself known in
all Minerals, by its white Smoak, ancl by its foetid
garlick-like Smell, when you put them upon burn-
{ij'g Coals, or in a small Veffel made white hot in the

ire.

330. F inally‚ you are to observe here, that Arse-
nick lies hidden in a great many {imple Stones and
Earths, especially those that spine, and adheres
