2²5² The ART of

Earth of Copper and Iron joined together, which must
at last be separated by Means of avery strong, open,
long-lasting Fire‚ and by other Remedies already-
mentioned in the Processes about these Metals.

3. If you want the Apparatus necessary sor this
Process, or care not to give yourself so much Trou'·
ble; you may have Recourse to a plain Roasting;
and put, for Instance, one docimastical Centner into
a Test covered with another Test inverted‚ and roast
it under the Muffle of the docimastical F urnace, or in
a gentle open Fire ssowly applied, like an Ore to
be prepared for F ufion: In which you are to take
care, that the remaining Calx be not brought to a
F usion, or rendered clammy‚ by a greater Heat than
it can bear: This done, if it ceases to spread an un-
pleasant sulphureous Srnell·‚ let it grow cold, and
weigh it, to know how short it falls of one Centner:
Which Deficiency will be the Qantity of Sulphur
that was in the Ore. But, it is proper that you
ihould know, either from the outward Appearance,
or from the Smell which your Ore emitts‚ that it is
indeed sulphur Ore, or that Sulphur is at least prevail-
ing in it 3 because all volatil Substances occafion a Di-
minution in theWeight of Ores, by roasting: Nor will
you be as sure of the Purity of your Sulphur, and
of Course of the Qantity of it when rec‘tified, as if
you had collected the volatile Part itself.

4. You may know bituminous Minerals (Part I.
§ 318. effe.) from the F lame which they take
in the Fire‚ from a thick sooty Smoak‚ which rni-
neral Sulphur never emits, and from their offenfive
or pleasant Smell: They may also be tried with
greater Exa&nesS‚ by Distillation out of a Retort,
in several Degrees of Fire.
