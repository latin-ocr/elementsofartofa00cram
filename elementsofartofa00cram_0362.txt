small Pit may be both quite covered over. Mal<e in
the Place where the Channel and small Pit are con-
tiguous to the upper-Coal, a small Hole through the
whole Thickness of it. Then join both Coals toge-
ther with an iron-VVire, or with Lute applied at the
omtS.

J 3. Pur this Apparatus upon Albes or Sand,⁴ that it
may not vacillate, and in a declining Sstuarion, that
the Aperture ofthe Channel may be uppermost, and
look towards the Affayer, and the back-Part, where
the small Pit is, be much lower. Theti, surround
it on all Parts with black and burning Coals·, in such
Manner however, that the Paffage of the Wind
through the Channel before, may not be intercepted.
Now, if you blow the Fire with a Pair of hand-
Bellows, so as that the Blast may enter direffly into
the open Extremity of the Channel‚ and again go
out through the Hole made in the Upper-Can, the
Flame following the same Direffion, soon melts the
Ore in the Channel, and reduces it at the same Time ε
Which is also helped on by the Pitch. But so soon
as.t'he Ore is in sulion, the Metal runs into the same
Pit, where it is free from the great Violence of the
Fire. This done (which is perceived by Sight,
or felt by a small iron-Wire) remove the burn-
ing Coals amand, and with a small Brush sprinkle
it softly, and Drop by Drop with Water ·‚ that the
Regulus of Tin may indeed be quickly cooled, but
not diffipated in Graios.
