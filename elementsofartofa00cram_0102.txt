84 The ART of

Door‚ and at about half the Height of this bottom
Part, let a round Hole be made, one lnch and a half
in Diameter‚ to admit the Pipe of the Bellows when
Need requires, Next to this, let another botron] Part
be made of the same Matter and Figure as the forego-
ing: Letit be likewise of the same Diameter, but two
Inches higher, so that it may be of the Height of seven
Inches. Likewise let it have round it a like iron-
Ring below its upper Border, to support the Body
of the Furnace to be received in it. But leta Hole
two or three Inches broad, and one Inch high (Fig.
X. c), be cut out just below this Ring, in the Side
of this bottom Part. Then let another round Hole
be made in the left Side of this first Hole, fit to ad-
mit the Pibe of the Bellows (d), Fui-ther, let ano-
ther round Hole like the foregoing (e) be made on
the right, and at the Distance of one luch from the
Bottom. Then let the whole Infide of this bottom
Part (the Part above the Ring excepted) be overlaid
with Lute‚ and a Bed be made at the Bottorn, of a
Figure like that represented by the Line (fg h). The
Matter of which this is made, is common Lute pulve-
med, passed through a Sieve‚ and mix’d with such
a Qantity of Dust of Charcoal, fifted in the same
Nlanner‚ as that the Mixture being moistened in the
same Manner as the Ashes (§ 178), and preffed
down, may at least be lightly coherent. Of this
Matter preffed on the Bottom of the buttem-Part, a
Bed is made, like a Segrnent of a Sphere, having in
the Middle a small Cavity somewhat lower, and
made extremely smooth, after the Manner mentioned
before (§ 184.) when we spoke of large Ash-Ves-
sels or Tests.

240. This Furnace (§ 239.) is chiefly fit for Fu-
fions, which may be made in it with and without
Vefsels. When you are to melt with a Veffel, put
the Body of the Furnace (Plat. III. Fzssg. VI.) upon
the first Botton] (th. IX.) that has a Door to it to
open on Hinges ·‚ introduce two Iron Bars (Fzg. XI.)

through the Holes of the F urnace (Fzg. VI. c c) put
