ther, so that a Mass cannot be attracsted with equal
Strength by the Load-stone. The eafier and more
difficult melting ofIr0n‚ and its Qality, when melt-
ed, likewise do depend upon these kinds of MixtureS.
Resides, the Bodies which are contiguous to Iron
only on the Ouffide, are partly taken up along with
it by the Load—stone‚ let the Iron or its Ore be ever so
fine-ly pulverized. For this Reason, you must have
Recourse to an Examination by Fire, to know with
Certainty the Qantity and Qality of the Iron to be
reduced out of the Ore.

APPARATUS.

ι. Roast for a few Minutes‚ in a Test under the
Muffel‚ and with a pretty strong Fire, two Cent-
ners of the small Weight of your ison-Ore grossy
pulverized ε That the Volatiles may be diffipated in
Part, and the Ore itself be softened‚ in case it should
be too hard. When it is grown cold, beat it ex-
tremely fine, and roast it a second Time, as you do
the ‹topper-Ore, but in a much stronger Fire3 till it
no longer emits any Smell : Then let it grow cold
acram.

02. Compose a Flux of three Parts of the white
Flux (Part 1. § 163), with one Part of fufible pul-
verized Glass, or of the like sterile unsulphureous v
Scoria33 and add glass-Gall and coal-Dust of each
one half-Part. Add of this Flux three Times the

’ Qantity of your roasted Ore, and mlx the whole

very well together. Then chuse a very good Cruci-
ble, well rubbed with Lute within, to stop the Pores
which may be here and there unseen3 put into it
your Ore mixt with the Flux·, cover it over with
common Salt‚ and shut it close with a Tile, and with
Lute applied to the Joints.

² 3. Put the wind-Furnace upon its boumn-Part,
haVIng a Bed made of coal-Dust (Part Ι. Plate ΙΙΙ.

’ small Grate supported on its iron Bars, and a Stone
