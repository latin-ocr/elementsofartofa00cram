PROCESS LXXXII.

The chustng and preparing of Flz'nts for the making of
* cqastalline Glass.

APPARATUS.

ULVERIZ E Sand and soft Flints in an Iron·

Mortar‚ not rusty: And if it were rusty, you
must first grind in it common Sami, which will make
it perfeffly clean. This must always be done, when
you have a Mind to make crystalline Glass clear from
all Colour ε But, it is not neceffary to do it, when you
are willing afterwards to timeture your Glaffes with
Iron. For the making of the hardest Glaffes‚ chuse
the hardest Flints‚ such as are the black Flints that:
serve for Gun-Hints‚ and some very hard Qartzs
that will refist any File„ All those which either are
white, or grow such when calcined in the Fir-e, are
of this Kind. They must first be cleansed of the
chalky Crust commonly adhering to them‚· then cal-
cined in a strong Fire‚ and thrown as yet red-hot
into cold Water. Thus they will be sosteued, and be-
come the whiter‚ as they were blacker before. Wash
off the Ashes that may happen to adhere to them,
and at last pulverize them in a Morum that they
may pass through a very fine Sieve. 'When this
Powder is most subtile, if you have not a Mind to
tinge the Glass to be made of it with the Crocus’s
of Iron, pour upon it weak Aqua Fortis, or its
Phlegrn. Stirr it first several Times, and let it rest
for one Night‚ then decant it, and again wafh it se-¹
veral Times with pure warm Whter: You will thus
have Sand perfeffly sobdle, as good to make the
hardest crystalline Glaffes, as if you used Rock-
