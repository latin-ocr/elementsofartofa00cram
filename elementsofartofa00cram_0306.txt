tion, or no. For if you take your Speeirnen out of
the Granulation, you are perfeftly sure of the Pro-
portion of the Mixture.

2. Moisten ssightly again with VVater the granu-
lated Gold, and put it into a hollow Veffel of a suffi-
cient Capacity‚ and add common Sulphur pounded
to a fine Powder one quarter Part with regard to the
granulated Metal, and mix the whole well with your
Hands‚ that a small thin Crust of the pounded Sul-
phur may adhere to each moistened Graio. Put this
again into an earthen glazed Vessel, not nau-:h larger
than is neceffary to contain the Granula covered
with Sulphur : Shut the Pot close with a Tsse, and
close the Interstices with thin Lute, and put it thus
in the Middle of the Hearch of a Fire sufficiently
large. Make a circular Fire round the Pot, distant
from it about an Hand’s Breadth all round ·, which
must first be gentle, and afterwards increased gradu-
ally 3 that the Sulphur may be melred, and the Gra-
nula diffolved by it ε It will be a Sign of this Drffo-
ludon, if Fumes and small sulphureous F12=mes, be-
gin to break forth here and there, through the Joints‚
or through Chinks that may happen to be made:
Then remove your Fire‚ and when the Pot is grown
cool of itself, break it : You will find a black Mass,
, which you must colle& after having separated it from
the Pieces of the Por.

3.Make ready the wind-Furnace represented (Part I.
Plate ΙΙΙ. Fig. VI, or Plate IV. Fig.1)‚ and in the
aih-Hole of it, make a Bed with Late, to colle&
the Metal without any Loss, or any great Trouble‚
in case it should be spilt out of the Crucible that should
happen to break. Put into this Furnace a Crucible
full of the granulated Metal calcined in the foregoing
Manner, putting under it a Piece of Tile well dried,
for it to stand upon. Put upon this as many half
Ounces of granulated Copper, as there are Marks in
the Mixture in the Crucible: But if there is already
Copper in the Mixture ; do but compleat the Defici-
ency of every Ounce ε But if there is but οηὸἑ half
