described, there is a great Deal of Iron in the Cala-
mine, and moreover no inconfiderable Qantity of
unmetallick Earth.

413. You can never, by the only Force of Fire,
or by the help of the common reducing FluxeS, pro-
duce any Zink out of this Stone (ᾗ 412). However‚
the Agreeableness os the Flowers of the said Stone
(§ 412.) with those of Zink ς the changing of the red
Colour of Copper into the yellow gold Colour‚ which
Alteration is effec'ted both by the Calamine, and by
Zink † (ξ 88) ·, and finally, the Production of Zink
itsels out os the Lapis Calaminaris, to be obtained by
several manual Operations‚ require that we should
class it among Zink-Ores : os tbi* more particularly,
when we come to the Operatione.

414. Some Authors have given us several Observa-
tions‚ concerning the Ores that are proper to Zink,
and out of which it may be melted‚ as other Metals
are out of their Ores. But though I would not inva-
lidate their Authority ·, there are however many Rea-
sons, why I cannot believe, that the Ores to which
they ascribe the Name of Zink, are such in reality.
For, 1. Zink is confounded with Bismuth by several
Authors : so that both these Names are looked upon
as synonymous ·, while there is nevertheless a very great
Difference between these two Boebes, as it clearly
appears from the Charaeteristicks os each, exhibited
(ξ 14, 15), and which are easily discerned by the
Senses·‚ not to mention greater Differences‚ between
them, which are manifested by Chemical OperationS.
It will be enough, for Instance‚ to mention one single
Author, even G. L. de Lohnejy's, a Man indeed of no
little Rank among Metallurgists, and who neverthe-
theless‚ speaking of the Manner in which the Zink-
of Gestar is got out os its Ore, says 3 Hoc Zinquum

† Out of Zink and Copper may be made as finea beautiful
yellow Metal, resembling Gold to the Eye‚ as the same-us Bath-
metal so long in vogue, or a more modern Metal at present, in
great Use sor Cane-heads, Buckles‚ and other Toys.
