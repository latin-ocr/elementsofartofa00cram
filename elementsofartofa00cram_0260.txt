3. The Silver that was in the Ore and the Lead,
will remain in the Coppei : If you take out of it the
Bead proceeding from the Lead‚ you will have the
Weight of the Silver contained in the Ore. If the
Ore empioyed was easy to be melted, all the Scoria
vanishes3 but if it was refractory or not fusible‚ ΕΗ
the Scoria does not always0 σο away3 but there re·
mains now and then something of 1t in the Form
of Dust. A great many Ores and Metals may be
tried in this Manner, except only such as split and
corrode the Coppels: There are likewise some of
them, which must be previoussy prepared, in the
fame Manner as is required, to render them fit for
going through a Scorification. See all the foregoing
Proceffes.

‘she Uli· and Reafhns of the Process.

ς. The Ore thrown at several Times upon Lead
boihng ina Coppel, may be diffoived without the
foregoing Scorification. But this is very far from
having an equa] Success with all Kinds ofOres : For
there are Ores and Metals which resist very much to
theirDIssoiution by Litharge3 and which being on this
Account thrown on the Border are not sufficiently
diffoived ; because the Litharge steels soon away into
{he Coppel. chrtheless, there are some others,
which vanissi intirely by this Method‚ except ‘the
Siiver and Gold that was contained in them.

2. A previous Roasting is necessary, first for the
Reasons mentioned (ΡΙ-οε. IV. Uſs ΝΟ. 1.) and the-n
because the Ore thrown upon boiling Lem, should
not crackle and ieap out. ’ For, having once paffed
the Fi re, it bears the rnost sudden Heat.

Though this Method requires no previous Sco-
eihcatiom you are not to conclude from thence, that
it is the same with the Ope ration by which Metallur· ‘
gsts ieparateSilver from its Ores: For 1n these Cases
:i Scorification is aiways previoussy made : For which
