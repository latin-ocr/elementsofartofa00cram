ASSAYING METALS. 379

· the Outfide, ofa bluish Colour, smooth within, and

yellow. Nor is it dubious, that there are several na-
tive Minerals, or several Kinds of Tutty produced
from them, that would have the same Effeci: But, it
is highly probable, that their Nature is hitherto un-
known to ωε, because the Examination of them has
been neglested to this Day.

3. Copper tinged in this Mamer, when it pre-
serves its Malleability, is called Brass οι· yellow Cop-
per ; a'nd as it is, by its Beauty, easy Tractability,
and long Duration, very fit to make Utenfils‚ and
the metallick Mass is so easily increased in the mak-
ing of it3 on this Account, a very great Quantity of
it is made in several Places, when the necefl'ary Ingre-
dients may be conveniently prepared.

4. The Flowers, which are collected during the
making of Brass, or the melting of it a second

, Time, and the roasting of the Calamine, as also

the Flowers of Zink itself not yet intirely burnt ς
likewise, all the Sublimates proceeding from Bodies
of the same Nature, being cemented in the same
Manner as the Calamine, that is, with Charcoal-dust
and Plates of Copper, and melted, make Brass of the
best Kind. But, the same being burnt in a ssow Fire‚
are so fixt, that in closeVeffels, and a strong Fire with
a Draught of Air, they turn to a yellowilh Glass; as
is well observed by Henckel concerning Zink ·‚ how-
ever, he would, it seems, have this understood only
of the F lowers of it ε See Proc. LXV. Appar. ΝΟ. 4.
5. Itis a wonderful Thing, that Zink itself being
plainly melted with Copper, robs it of all its Mal-
leability ε As may be experienced in the making of
Prince's-metal (Part Ι. § 88) ε While being at the
same Time applied by way of Vapour, and lying
hidden in the Calamine, in the Sublimates, and in
the Flowers, it does not take away the Malleability.
If this does not proceed from the Concurrence of
Lead, according to the Opinion of the Author just
quoted, or from a very intimate Junffion of the
Zink and Copper, the Reason of it is still a perfect

Secret
