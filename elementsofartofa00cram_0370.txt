quicker in maileable purified Iron, than in Iron to

PROCESS LVI.

The Preparation of Steel out of Iron, by C ementation.

T E E L is made of Iron in two different Mamers,
S viz. by Cernentation (Part I. §459.)‚ or by Fu-
fion. The Cementation is performed in the follow,
ing Manner. ’

APPARATUS.

ι. Chuse some Barre of pure Iron, not over-thiCk‚
and quite free from heterogeneous Matters, the F lexi-
bleness ofit, both when hot and when cold, is a very
good Sign thereof. Prepare a Cement composed of
such Ingredients as emit an abundant PMogiston,
when agitated by the Fire, provided the said Phlo-
giston be altogether free from the sulphureous mine-
ral Acid: Such as are all extinguished CoaIS, and in
short all Parts of Animals and Vegetable33 among
which, those, however, are much so, which contain a„
greater Qantity of Oil in them, and which being freed
of an exccss‘ive Phlegm‚ have been burnt before into
a semi-carbonaceous MasS. Avoid whatever absorbs
0in Vapous with great Fome, or even spreads the
Acid of Sulphur‚ or the mineral Sulphur itself. It
is better to add a few Compositions‚ in Order to
clear the Matter.

Take Charcoal-dust moderately pulverised 1 P‘. of
Wood-ashes. ὲ P‘. Mix them, together.

Take Charcoal-dust 2 1³¹⁵. Bones, Horns, Leather,
Hairs of Animals (it is all one if you use but one,
or several, or even all of thern rhixt together; fon
one of them alone is as sufficient as the Mixture of
thern all) burnt with a gentle Fire till they are black
in a close Veffel, then pulverise them 1 P‘. W00d÷
ames-,¹2 1³¹. Mix thern together.
