diffoived in c01d water, but they melu most qui'ckly
and in great Quantity in warm Water. Such are

Nitre‚ Tartar, Tartar vitriolate‚ all Vitriols‚ Allum,
&a some of them melt easily enough and in good,
Qantity, equally in cold and warrn Water3 nay,
even in the Air, when they have absorbed the
Moisture of it: And though they melt a little
quicker in warm than in cold Water‚ yet the Diffe-
rence is very small. Of this Nature are, common Salt‚
vegetable fixt alkaline Salts, and even several neutral
Salts diffolvible in the Air. T herefooe, the less the
Difference of the Qantities of the Salts which are
diffolved both in warrn and cold Water, is, the less

’ Qantity of Crystals you will get, and on the con-
trary. You will understand this better, if illustrated

by an Example. Let Nitre be diffolved in cold Wa-
ter, to a Saturation3 and the Solution boil in an
open Vefi'el: The Water will be so disposed by the
Heat‚ as that a much greater Qantity of Nitre may
be diffolved, besides what is already so z Which may
be eafily experienced. But, so soon as the Water be-

tain all the diffolved Nitre‚ which being then at the
Surface which is less warm, is nevertheless first of
all deprived of its Water‚ and expelled in Form ol
a small Pellicle, which retards the further Evapora-
tion. If you continue to inspiffate by increasing the
Fire, the whole Nitre turns to an unformed Mass:
“ But, if the boiling Solution is put in a cold Place,
there remains as much Nitre in the Solution‚ as may
have been diffolved in that Degree of Cold, by a
Qantity of Water equal to that which is in the So-
lution. The rest is separated in Form of Crystals, that
is, above half of the Nitre‚ if the Atmosphere is
very cold3 and less, if it is, very warm. Apply the
same to Brine. But as a cold and very saturated So-
lution of common Salt admits but very little more
Salt‚ if it is made warm, the small Crystals appear

at the Surface, in the very {eginmng of the Evapo-
e 3 ration,
