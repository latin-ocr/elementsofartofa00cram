*56 . The ART of

the Mass pretty compnc't, tak' ing care lest the Pestle
ssiould rub against the Sides of the Mortar. 3. Hav-
in ng then removed the Pestle, strew the upper Part of
the Cavity of the small Veffel, with Ashes of dry
Bones ground extremely fine (§ 175), which is done
with the Sieve (Plat.1.Fzg.1V] . Again, put the
Pestle into the MOrtar, after having first wiped it
wit h a clean Rag, and drive it pretty strongly with
one or two Blows more. 4. Then have at hand a
small wooden Plank, strewed a Qarter of an Inch
thick with dry Ashes, put upon it the Mortar con-
taining the Coppel already prepared, so that the lesss
ser ssafis of it be underneath ·, press it against the
small Board: the Coppel will then easily quit its
Mould z Let next the prominent Inequalities at, the
upper Edge and Bottom of the Coppel, be cut off
with a ssmrp Knife: Finally, let the Coppel inverted
be laid afide in a dry place,

179. Therefore, the dry Ashes called Cher, must
be applied to the Inlide of the Coppel, that the little
Inequalities most commonly remaining there, may be
filled, and make a Sort of very fine Sieve, admitting
through it vitrified Bodies, and retaining Gold and
Silver .· Thus, when the Cavity of the Coppel is
carel'ully done over with these Alhes, it will be no
great Harm, if the Mass (§ 178.) used for the mal<-
ing of Coppels, happens to be defiled with a small
Mixture of vad or of ·³ny other Powcler more easy
to be vitrified. And inde ed it is hardly poffible to
av oid tl is Fault entir,ely εἰ pec ially when you use
Vv‘ ood- Ashes. Thence the Reason is plain, why
this Dust (ᾗ 175.) must be prepa ared with so much
care. Therelo e great Cautions are to be taken,
that the levigation of this Dust be not made upona
soft Smne .· because Particles of it being by Chance
rubbed off might spoil the Powder.

180. The Coppels ought to be rather more than
less coinpaet: the la tter being always hurtfu13
wherea s the for mer, by absorbing the Glass more ssow-
ly, does but re tarci the Operation a little.
