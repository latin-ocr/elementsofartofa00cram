tals, and Semi-MetaIS‚ different from those above·-

mentioned, nay perhaps Minerals that could not be '

referred to any of these Claffes: Nor can we deny it, “’
When we consider that Nitre‚ which, as far as we
know, was a Secret to the AncientS, has been found

Coroll. As the Art of Affaying reaches the Nature
and Difference os simple Minerals, and the'Mixture

of those compounded, its usefulness is evident for the
’ compleating natural History. Nor is it less useful
and necessary in Metallurgy. For as no Man can-
pass any certain Judgment upon the Nature of Mine-
rals, from the bare Inspeffion of thern, he must for
that purpose have Recourse to docimastical Experi-
ments. Let us take, for an Example, some Lead
Ore, ofa yellowish green Colour, and rnix'd with
Crystals resembling Spar, {hootinglike Nitre‚ which,

as far as I know, is found in one Place only. Let us

suppose a Man to have seen Lead Ore of all forts,
this very rare one excepted, the bare Inspeeiion, the
Figure, Colour, and Weight of it, wil} never make
him find out, that this Ore is very rich in Lead3
which any Man ss<illed in these Things will confess-to
be true of many others. Erclcer speaks of workers
of mines, who had, with no small Detriment‚ mi-
staken Ores of Tin for Ores of Iron *.

35. The Ain] of docimastical Operation is two-
fold; viz. to know, first, what kind and what quan-
tity of each Miner-al is contained in the compounded

Subje&; secondly‚ what kind and how much may be
extraCted out of it, with some Benefit,

Scholion. The lVorkers of Minas are often mzssed hy
the Affayers, who make their Trials in such a Method,
and with fitch Addimus, as can never be used in greater

Ope-rahans, on account of the vast Expence and Trouble
which attend them. For when the Operation is under-

taken wilh that Wew, the Method of it ought to be such
czs can be imitated and pztrsued in larger Works, or in the
