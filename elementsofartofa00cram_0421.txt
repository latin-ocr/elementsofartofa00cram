ASSAYING METALS. 395

· must be cautious in this Process, not to use small Bits

osArsenick dispersed in small Chip-Boxes‚ or wrapped
up in Paper. For the minutest animal or vegetable
Fibre makes a pretty impetuous Deflagration with
Nitre melted or burning : For which Reason also,
you are to use the cleanest Tools; lest any Phlogiston
should get into it. Next, make the Operation under
a Chimney, which carries Smoak very well ς lest a
noxious Vapour should annoy you, If the Mixture
of Nitre and Arsenick is once put into Vessels well
luted‚ to distil the abovementioned Spirit3 by in·

ἵ creafing the Fire‚ the Mixture breaks the Veffels

asunder with a Noise‚ just asif a Phlogiston had been
mixt with the Nitre, resembling a true Inflammati0n‚
not without some Danger for the People that stand by.

3. The Confistence of Arsenick varIes‚ and chiefly
depends upon the Fire applied to it. For Instance,
if an arsenical Vapour finds a colcl Place, it applies
itself to solid Objeets in Form osa Powder, az Sul-
phur does, which Powder is more subtile in Proper-
tion as it is more remote from the F ire. Arsenick
is colleffed under this Form in large Operations‚
which are made, while the arsenical Ore is thrown
into the Furnace with the Fuel of the Fire, out of
which F urnace the Srnoak is laterally conveyed
through a Funnel, into a large Channel made with
wooden Boards. This Channel- is several Fathoms
long: Nor is the Direffion of it strait‚ but forming
several Elbows, to the End that the Smoak may
meet with more frequent Obstacles, by which being·
retarded it may apply itself, while the rest goes out
at last, through a wooden Funnel construdied at the
other Extremity of the Channel. This Powder is
called in German OEifflssmebb and it has a grey or
aih-Colour, caused by the Smoak of the Fire. But if
it is sublimed in acovered Veffel, lest it lhould fly
away too freely, the arsenical F lowers begin to grow
clammy, in that Part of the Veffiel- which is at last
made hot by the long Continuation of the Fire,
