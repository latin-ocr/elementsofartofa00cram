tate (§ 332.) by Art natural Concretes of this Kind:
and it indeed has succeeded very well with some.
Thus for Instance, the Silver vitreous Ore, the Ores
of Mercury, and of Regulus of Antimony, may, by
Art, be rendered perfect and like the natural ones 3
ifto Silver you join Sulphur, or Regulus of Antimony
by Fufion, and to Mercury by Trituration and Subli-
mation. But the other Ores have not hitherto been
so well imitated by Art: nay, this gives Birth to
Produsts very different, though you use the same
Ingredient5‚ such as may be fetched out of natu-
ral Bodies, and even in the same Proportion.
But the Reason of this Variety, seems to be in the
Manner and Time, in which Afstnick and Sulphur
are by Nature joined with Metals or Semi-metals not
yet thoroughly tried, and sometimes perhaps, when
there is another Body, either not known at all, or
not sufficiently known : such is the Earth containing
no Metal in the true Pyrites and Cobalt (ξ 316, 325),
the Nature of which is not yet tried, with a sufficient
Degree of Certainty.

334. Ores (§332.) are distinguished by Affiyers,
into fusible, relrastory, and not fusible atall‚ accord-
ing to their relative Dispofitions, with regard to the
Fire and the Μειζίίνιια. Those are. called fufiblc,
which, either by Means of a middling Fire only, or
by adding a fit splenstruum to them, melt easily, and
as far as is necessary to obtain the Fufion of a Metal
or Semi—metal. The RefraFtory arc those, which re-
quire a very strong and lasting Action of the Fire,
to be melted in the requislte Manner. But when
they cannot be melted in the most violent Fire alone,
and require the additional Action of a Menstruum,
to be put in Fufion, they are called not fufible.
β But it is plain enough, that there are still many dif-
ferent Degrees, in each of these Classes.

335. The Reason of the Disposition of Ores in the
Fire, and with regard to the Menstrua, lies hidden
either in the Nature itself, or, as they call it, in the.
Effence of the Ore, or in the Nature of some Body
