PROCESS LXXI.

The purzfying ofArsem'ck by Sublimcztion with cz fixt Alkali,
to make it white and crjstczlline.

APPARATUS.

F instead of Mercury (Proc. LXX.) you use afixt

Alkali well burnt, such as Pot-ash 3 there comes
forth a half-transparent, white, solid, hard, ponde-
rous Sublimate of Arsenick‚ which adheres below,
and pulverulent white Flowers join to it above. But
the Fire, must be much more violent in this Subli-
mation than in the foregoing‚ especially towards the
End : 'Wherefore you must also chuse higher vessels,
that the arsenical Vapours may find a Space less

warrn to which they can apply themselves. You are
also to take Care, not to add more Alkali than is

necessary to retain the Phlogiston : Which cannot be
exaffly determined: For you will obtain Arsenick

with greater Difficulty, and in leffer Qantity, as
you use a greater Qantity of salt, and on the con-
tra'llyhe Separation of the Phlogiston will succeed with
a small Qantity of Arsenick, if you first sprinkle
the Arsenick reduced to a very fine Powder, with a

very pure alkaline Solution, and then dry it-ssightly
before the Sublimation. Likewise, more Arsenick is

produced by this Method in a gentle F ire.

<The Lsse and Reasons of the Process.

1. Fixt Alkali well burnt in* an open Fire, is very
greedy of a Phlogiston, if you except Acids and
Water on certain ConditionS, and when it has ab·
sorbed it, it does not entirely quit it again easily,
unless you hinder the too free Affion of the Air ; let a
the Violence of your Fire be ever so great: Which
