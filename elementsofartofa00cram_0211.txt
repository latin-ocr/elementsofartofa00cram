AssAv1NG METALS. 193

these Metals be not mixed together in too small Pro-
portions: for if one thousandth Part of Lead was
mixt with the Copper·, {9³ vice versa, the Eliquation
defired would not succeed. 2. It is sometimes neces-
sary to add IngredientS, that may either destroy the
Force by which the several Parts cohere together, or
even sometimes procure an eafier Flux of the Matter:
sor the Mixtures of the other Mentis, cannot without
Additions be separated by Eliquation, as Copper and
Lead were just said to be. For Instance‚ Gold, Sil-
ver, and Copper‚ confounded together, rem-ain in

the same State in any Degree of Fire. Therefore,
’ to make the Eliquation of the Gold and Silver, out
of such a Mixture, you must use the same Additions
as in the (ᾗ 467.) Precipitation by Fusion. Sulphur
added in this Case, does indeed dispose the Copper to
abandon the Gold and Silver ε but if these two, as it
most commonly happens, are mixt in a very small
Qantity' to a very considerable one of Copper ; then
you cannot yet obtain the Separation of them : For
besides, that what we said before (ὅ 469.) concerning
the Eliquation of Copper and Lead, is also true
here ·‚ Sulphur does also render Copper fioid, by al-
most the same Degree of Fire‚ by which Gold and
Silver are melted. Wherefore‚ a considerable Qum-
tity of Lead must be added in this Case ·‚ that by
Help of it, the Gold and Silver may be dissolved in
a gentle Fire ·‚ and thus the Copper be in a Mannet

washed out of them.
’ 470. Both these (ᾗ 465, 468.) Operations are of
infinite use in Metallurgy: for, by Means of them,
minute Portions of Gold and Silver, may, without
any great Expence be separated from a large Mass of
other Metals: which it has not hitherto been possible
to effe& with Profit, by any other Method. Never-
theless, these Operations have not been hitherto so far
cultivated, as that Precipitation by Fufion, and
Eliquation may succeed completely in all Mixtures of
Metals: for which Reastm, Metals that are of a
