Precipitation, and by the Sulphur and Arsenick
still remaining, be separated from the Copper3
whereas, both Metals would otherwise be confounded
together by a subsequent Fufion‚ the Sulphur and
Arsenick being intirely diffipated‚ and could hardly

be separated (Proc. XLI. Uſs ΝΟ. 2.).

PROCESS XLIV.

To find out how much pure Copper may be produced by
Scorzfication, out of black Copper.

Hoever attempts to find this out with theTouch-
οὓ stone, must be acquainted with the Use of the
Proofineedles (Part l. § 289.) ; one of which must be
made of the purest Copper, the others of black Copper
more or less pure ·‚ the Nature and Goodness of which
may be ascertained by the foregoing ExperimentS.
Then the Copper to be examined‚ must be rubbed
upon theTouch-stone‚ and compared with the Needles
rubbed upon it in the same Manner. If the black
Copper is of the best Kind, aster having compared
the Colour and Ductility of it with the Needles,
you may in some Measure judge of the Goodness of
it. But, if it is less pure, you can conclude nothing
that is certain by this Method ; because the Colour
and Confistence of Copper may be changed by many
Causes‚ sometimes by one, sometimes by several at
once, there being a Multitude of Proportions that
concur to vary it a thousand different Ways. For,
Copper‚ for instance, is rendered white equally by a
great Deal of Tin, by a little of Bismuth, and by a
a very little Arsenick. What will then be your Un-
certainty, if many other Causes concur with those
just mentioned, to increase it! You must then exa·
mine your Metal by another Method.
