AssAYING METALS. 311

The Use and Reusbns of the Proust.

1. In this F ufion, the Ore melts on Account of too
sudden an Application of the F ire 3 for this Reason
it loses its Sulphurand Arsenick only in a small Qan-
tity (Proc. XXXIX. us N⁰ ι.) the Rest joins more
strictly with the fixt Substance of the Ore. Therefore,
as Iron, which abounds in every Pyrites, separates
the Sulphur and Arsenick from all the other Metals
and semi-Metam, and unites them to itself (Part, Ι.
§ 147. coroll. 1.) ς on this Account these heavy Bo·
dies smk to the Bottom‚ and the Iron, freed of Sul-
phur and Arsenick, swims a-top, together with the
unmetallick Earth. But this Separation does not suc-
ceed so perfeffly, but there remains something of the
Iron and of the unmetallick Earth in the Regulus,
and some Copper in the Scoria’s : The Reason of this
is, that the Iron which is in the pyritose Ore is not
sufficient to absorb all the Sulphur and Arsenick, and
that by Means chiefly of the Arstmick, which, toge-
ther with the Metals‚ turns to a reguline semi-metal-
lick Substance‚ Part of this subtil Earth remains joined
to the Regulus. ¹This Regulus is called Lupis Capri,
in German nuntiem, {Rupfetstm'm &a because it has hi-
therto preserved the Nature of the crude Pyrites,

2. But every pyritose Copper-Ore must not be made
to go through this rough Melting3 but only that
which has a great Deal of iron and a little Copper in
it. For, the Reason why the melting is done here
without a previous Roasting, is, (ι.) that the Iron may
be separated from the Copper·, which is performed
like a Precipitation 'oy F ufion, through the Action
of the Sulphur upon the Iron (N‘> 1.) ε Nor could the
Separation of so much Iron from the Copper be
made with any Benefit by another Method. (2.) That
the melting may be performed conveniently: For il
an Iron-pyrites is deprived of its Sulphur by roastiug,
it is hardly tractable by Fire alone, on Account of
the refractory Nature of the martial Earth: This may
