163. If equal Parts of the same Ingredients (§162.)

are detonated in the same Mamer, the Oil is almost
entirely consumed by the abundance of Nitre, and the
rest looks like an ash or white colour'd Salt, more al-
kaline and sharp than the foregoing 3 wherefore it is
called Fluxus albus, or white Flux.

164. The Fluxus albus (§ 163.) is very efficacious
to dissolve δίωκε and Earths ; but of a less reducive
Virtue·, and destroys the Metal, when the Fire is
continued a little longer than is required.

165. These Fluxes are likewise of very great Ser·
vice, to reduce Metals from their respective Calxs,
and to free them from the Stones, in which they are
inherent. But when the refractory Calx of Iron is to
be reduced by a great and long lasting Fire 3 these
Fluxes being infinitely attenuated‚ though confined in
close VeffeJS, 1. part from their oily Principle 2
2. then their alkaline Salt remaining still, they be-
gin to consume the VeffelS‚ of what Matter soever
they may be made (ᾗ 97), and ssip away, making
their way through them. The first Fault is mended‚
by adding Coal-dust, because this loses not its fixed
Oil, without the Help ofa free Air : The other Fault
is remedied with common Glafir made of a due Mixture
of Flz'nts and fixed Alkalz· : For this is fufible enough,
it melts with Fluxes added to it, and by its Viscoslty

, in a Manner coagulates and saturates the Sall, and

thus hinders it from easily corroding the Veffels.

166. Artificers compose a great many Fluxes with
the above—mentioned Salts (ξ 97, 130.) and with the
reductive ones3 nay, some use as many different
Fluxes as there are different Oars and Metals; all
which, however, we think altogether needless to de-
scribe. It is better to have explained a few of the:-
fimpler ones, which serve for all the othem, and are
