19⁴2 The ART of

Form of Barth, or in that of a solid Ore · in the first
Case, you make Glass by a bare Fufion· in the se-
cond, if the Sulphur and Arsenick, which together
with the meta 'lick Part do constitute an Ore, are
scattered by the Roasting (ᾗ 463. ) the Ore destitute of
the oily Phlogiston, becomes Glass in a pure Fire;
which Glass may be mixt with unmetallick Stones and
Earths: but, by adding Phlogiston to it, this me-
tallick Glass is reduced to its metallick Form‚ and
so long as it keeps under this Porro, it cannot be
united t'with the Glass of the other SpecieS‚ but finks
to the Bottom of 1t; except only a very small Qan-
tity of lt, which is detained by the Clamminess of the
GlasS. Therefore the precipitating Body here is
truly the Phlogiston. For any Body that takes away
the Connexion, by the Removal of which a Precipi-
tation is operated‚ is called precipitating‚ in German
ssienerssatljlass. ’

468. When such is the Nature of the Ores, or of
the metallick Mixtures‚ that while one Part of them
melts in the Fire, the other more refractory remains
still solid, then the first melted in a mild Fire, flows
out of the Interstices of the other, and is thus sepa-
rated. Which kind of Separation is called Eliquati-
on, in German &amaruan ὅᾖ.

469. The Perfection of this Operation (ξ 468.)
requireS, 1. the different Fluidity of the Parts that
constitute the Mass. Lead‚ for Instmce, melts into
one Mass with Copper in a great Fire ς whereas both
cannot dissolve each other in a middling Fire: but if
the Mass composed of both Bodies confounded toge-
ther, is afterwards exposed to a mild Fire on an in-
clined Plane, then the Lead alone melts, and the
Copper become brittle and spongy, remains in its
solid Form. However, this Separation is not so per-
fectly made, bnt there remainsa little Lead in the Cop-
per, and a little Copper is carried away by the Lead :
Wherefore, it, is re quisue, for this Experiment, that
