and contains the Metal, must be a spherica] Segment‚
not very deep 3 first, that the Surface of the melted
MasS, let this be ever so much diminished‚ be suffi-
ciently vifible to the Eye of‘the Artificem secondiy,
that the Metal left in that Cavsty, may melt together
in one Globule. But the outsldes of the Coppels must
be only a small Matter convergent towards the Bafis,
like a truncated Cone3 that it may stand firm upon
its Bafis.

177. But that this Fignre (25 175.) may eafily be
given the Coppels, you are to have Copper or Ersfi
Moulds, the Figure of which is described (Plat. Ι.
Fig. I. and ΙΙ.) where we have added an exa& Ex-
planation. You likewise find their various Sizes, ac-
cording to the Qantity of the Metal to be worked
in the Coppels.

178. With all these Preparations (ᾗ 168—177.)
you will make the docimastical θαρρεῖς. 1. Take
Ashes ofBone5‚ of Beasts, or ofFissiess aione, or two
Parts of VVood Ashes (ᾗ 174.) and one Part of dry
Ashes of Bonos (ᾗ 171.) mix them well in a Mortar,
or upon Porphyry ·, rhen add to them by Drops just

Water, as will bc ncceffiry to make the Matter stick
together, when stroi'zgly preffed between the Fingers,
and not more or ies-¹2· ε Or if you nse Spaad (ᾗ 173.)
let it be sprinkled in tirc- same [stannes with a Solution
of Vitriol. Put a large Qantiry of the wetted Dnst
into a small Mortar (Plat. Ι. Fig Π.) supported up-
on a firm Pr0p3 press down with your Fingers the
Mass poured loosely in3 that the Capoeiry of the
Mortar may be quite full ofit·, and lay the Remainder
aside. 2. Put the Pestle perpendicular (Plat. I. Eg. I.)
into the Mortar, and then with a Mallet drive it with
three or four Blows, according to the different Diame-
ter of the Veff'el, that is to be made, and make
