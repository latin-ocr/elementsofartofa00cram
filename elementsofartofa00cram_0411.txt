passes with the Sulplmr, chiefly in the End of the
Distillation, when a stronger Fire is used. This ap-
pears plainly, when you urge with a strong Fire the
Refidue which remains in the Retort after the resti· ,
ficati0n3 for thena transparent red Arsenick, and
a red and yellow Arsenick, are sublimed and come
over. The Caput Mortuum which then remelius,
being roasted in a close Crucible‚ in a violent Fire, is
in great Part attracied by the Load-stone applied to
it, and when you extra& a Qantity of it somewhat

but brittle, and still containing a little Sulphur. The
Copper betrays itself‚ when you roast gently the
Caput Mortuum, then expose it to the Air for some
Days, and then extra& it with water: For Calx of
Copper may sometimes be precipitated out of this
water, by putting in it Plates of pure Steel‚ which
Calx must likewise be reduced to a Regulus (Proc.
XXXVIII). As then this is done in close Veffels,
and in a ssow Fire gradually increased, it is self-
evident, that the same succeeds still much better in
an open, strong Fire, suddenly applied, such as is
used by Affayers in the roasting of sulphureous‚ py-
ritose, arsenical Copper-ores‚ of which we have
spoken (Proc. XXXIX). But there does not remain
an equally great Portion of Caput Mortuum from all
Sulphur ε’ But if Sulphur is expelled out of a small
Qantity of Ore that has once undergone a ssow gen-
tle Fire in a Retort3 a very small Portion of it is
gotten: You obtain more of it, when a greater

Qantity of Sulphur is expelled hastily.

different Species of Sulphur, from the several Mix-
tures of& these heterogeneous Matters: For all pure
Sulphur is ever one and the sanie. For Instancej
