s1ble to affign 3 constant Proportion' in the
compofing of Glafl'es‚ on Account of the different
Degrees of Fufibleness in the Flints ·‚ therefore, we
ssmll here insert a few PrescriptionS, by way only of

If you add Arsenick‚ it must first be lntirnately mixt
with the Sala, especially Nitre, and this Mixture
be joined with the Flints. The Effe& of Arsenick
here, is, that the Salts dissolve the Flints with greater
Efficacy: And it does not entirely evaporare, as has
been already observed‚ but being in great Part fixt
by the Glass, it sust-ains the most violent Fire. Whe-
