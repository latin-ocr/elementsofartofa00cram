in them. They‚·in the first Case‚ are called by the
Germans OEismvffitbmet'ffig3 and in the second Case

ffliepsssscbmet'ffig. But they, by the VVord Ἄδωρα
« &cymam-g, understand in a special Manner, the sul-

phur-eous arsenical lead-Ore, Which on this Account
is rapacious‚ ofa yellow Colour, intermixt with ash-
coloured or blackish Spots‚ and somewhat sattilh to
the Touch.

376. The green lead—Ore, is very rare, ofa yel-
lowiih green Colour very much varied, and half
transparent. It varies its Figurae, though it most
commonly has that of Spaad, shutting in Forrn of
Nitre‚ butless regular. It is likewise. ponderous, not
hard, and at the same Time very rapacious( Ne-
verqheless, one hundred Pound weight of it yields
from 70 to 80 Pound weight of Lead. The white
and alh-coloured lead-Ore are looked upon as being
like this, and are every bit as rare.

377. The lead-Ores hitherto (ξ 373—376.) men-2
tioned, are never rendered refractory by a Mixture
ofiron-Ore‚ or of the sulphureous ison-Pyrites(§3 16),
as are the other Ores (ᾗ 336) : for unless the Ore that
contains Iron, be naturally associated to the lead-OrCS,
the major Part of Affayers, in order to roast them
with greater Ease and Benefit, commonly use an ad-
dition of Iron, or of its l‘ufi'ole Scoria's that are still
reducible. Of this, more at large, when we are up—
on the OperationS. However, the white arsenical
Pyrites (§ 323), if it is ever thought worthy to be
claffed among Ores, ought in this Case to be except-
ed, partly on account of its Rapaciousness‚ and partly

·· on account of the refraftory Quality (ᾗ 325.) of the

abundant terrestria] Caput Mortuum, that remains
of· it after the Arsenick has been blown away.
