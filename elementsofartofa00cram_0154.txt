341. As Metals and Semi-Metals are specifically
the most ponderotis of Minera133 and the Sulphur and
Arsenick, with which the former make up Ores, are
none of the lightest3 it is self—evident, that pure so-
lid Ores distinguish themselves from the other com-
pouni unmetaliick Minerils by their great Weight· ,
only afew Pyrites very sulphweous (ᾗ 316. ) excepted.
Ι iay pure iolid Ores : for when these are dispersed
here and there, in small Qiantities, among large
Maffes of Stones and Earths‚ they can never be dis-
tinguished by their Weight.

most every where, perfeftly known, and manifesting
itselfeasily, wherever it lies hidden, it deserves to be
placed here at the Head of the rest.
