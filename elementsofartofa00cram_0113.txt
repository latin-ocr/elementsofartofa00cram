from going out through their Funnels‚ and you force ft
out, on the contrary, through the third Cavity and
through its Funnel (5 5 5) ·‚ that it may also ast upon
the Bodies placed in that Cavity. For the more the
Funnel erefted upon the third Cavity is open, the more
one or even both Funnels of the other two Cavities
must be closed. Thence it is plain, that you cannot
kindle the strongest Fire in the third Cavity‚ unless
there be one equally strong in the other two3 and
that on the contrary, the Heat in the third Cavity
may be rendered less, by clofing its Funnel ; though
it be violent in the others, The same is true of the
second Cavity‚ with regard to the first. Finally, you
cannot make the strongest Fire under the Muffel
placed within the upper Door (e) of the Tower, un-
less you have an equal Fire in the first Cavity, which
Fire may consequently be increased, by ssiutting the
Door quite against the Muffel (e), and diminished,
by opening it·‚ there being mean while an equa!
Heat in the first Chamber, and in the following
ones, The Rest will easily be learned by Prastice.

245. Affayers make use of four Sorts of Tongs,
The first (Plat. IV. Figll.) confists of two iron-
Legs, two Foot long, as many Lines thick, joined
together in the Middle with a Rivet (a), so as that
they may be ssmt and opened steddily. Let the fore
Part of these Legs wherewith the Veffels are laid hold
of, be curved on the infide (b) intoa Semi-lunarFigure 3
and let the hinder Part have two Rings (c) to manage
the Tongs with. This Tool serves to draw the Tests
and smaller Crucibles out of the Fornace.

246. The second kind of Tongs are made ofa
Plate of Steel‚ hardened to a Spring-ternper. Let
them be fix Inches long, almost sharp in the fore Part,
and well polissied (Fzg. ΙΙΙ). With these you take
up the metallick Grains remaining in the Coppels,

and other minute Bodies.
