with an Hole ten Inches wide ·, so that there ma} be
left in the Back of it, a Margin two Inches broad
round the Cavity of the Furnace. This Margin ’
serves to support prismatical‚ quadrangulas, iron-
Βᾶτε, which must be put upon the round Hole, instead
of a Grate. These Iron-bars are fastened with a Stra*
tum ofthe best Lute of the same Thickness of thelim,
at the Placet where they rest upon the Margin. This
Lute must be neatly smooffied, that small Veffels may
be set upon it all round. Leave at the Base of the

The other Chamber built upon the soregoing, is a
fire-Place to put in the Fuel of the Fine, and of the
same Brcadth and Height as the foregoing ς unless
the Stones it is made of are less dni-able in the Fire :
For, in this Case, it must 'oe a few Inches broader‚
and be covered over with a Crust as many Inches
thick, of the best Lute that will bear the strongest
Fire. Let the Top of the Arch be perforated with a
round Hole fix Inches in Diameter, round the Cir-
cuit of it the Arch must not be thicker than a Fin-
ger’s Breadth. Let there bc upon the Back of this
Arch a Pavement four Inches broad, to put the Ves-
sels upon. Make in the Circumference of this
Chamber seven equidistant Doors, fix of which must
be four Inches broad, and as much high, and the
seventh two Inches larger, all of them terminated
a top by the Arch. Let the Bases of them be the
Height of two Inches distant from the Margin upon
which the Iron-bars are fixt‚ which Margin must be
confidered as the Pavement of this Chamber. Let
the Wall at the Bafis of each Door, and a't the above- -
mentioned Interval‚ be cut out on the Infide to one
third Part of its ThicknesS. But, let all the Doors
be of Iron, hung on Hinges, and made in the same
Manner as Part Ι. §239. ΝΟ. 4, coated two Inches
