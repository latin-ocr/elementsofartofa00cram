crete Body. Whence those who try to make Parget
with Spaad, get sometimes Illnesses‚ while they barke
their Parget‚ and their Moulds to cast Metal into:
For this Reason likewise‚ Spaad and Parget made
with it, which is done with a gentle Roasting,
sometimes melts in a strong Fire ·, whereas it could
not otherwise be brought to it by a great Fire. The
Efficacy of this Body is very great in promoting dry
Solutions, and it is conflderably increased‚ when it
is joined with a Body fixt in the Fire, and fufible3
for Instance, with plain Glass of Lead., or with Glass
made of Lead tainted with Arsenick, the Effe& of
which is much greater than common Litharge, or
Glass of Lead. You may find out in close Veffels

then sorne Arsenick, there willarise‚ towards the End
of the Operation‚ some F lowers of an orange-colom,
and 3 half-transparent ruby-coloured Sublimate, in
which the Arsenick lies hidden : For this is raised
along with the volatile Sulphur3 whereas it could
not otherwise be eafily detected by Sublimation. But
in Orpiment, which, befides the Arsenick‚ contains
a Qantity of Sulphur not inconliderable‚ the Earth
which in this Mineral contains hardly any Metal, is .
melted together with thern in a gentle F ire, and turns
to a half-transparent red Mass, out ofwhich you may,
by 3 gentle Sub‘limation, or by Means of a Despu-
madon, separate this Earth, which contains 3 great
Deal of Arsenick fixt in it, not to be diffipated with-

out 3 great open Fire, increased by Degrees‚ and
continued long.
