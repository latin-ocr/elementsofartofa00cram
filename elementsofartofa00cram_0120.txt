102 The ΑΜ· of

three Lines in Diameter : Put another at the Top of
the Column (e), and a third near the Bottom of it
(f) ε All which Pullies‚ must turn very ealily on their
Axis. At the Distance of one Inch and a half below
the upper Arm, let another Arm one Inch and a half
long (g) corne out of the Column at right Angles,
having a Hole through it (h) two Lines long, a
quarter of a Line broad, and placed perpendicularly
below the Pully of the upper Arm (f), to receive a
small Plate (i), one Inch and ahalflong3 and of such
Breadth and Thickness, as that it may freely move
up and down, and yet not have too much play within
the Hole. Moreover‚ let this Plate have a small
Hook at ench Extremity.

266. And as such a Balance is very tickliss³‚ and
will hardly stand still in the open Air, and becomes
false, when spoiled with Dust : It must be put together
with its Support into a small Case, having Glaffes at
Top and all round it, that you may see what is with-
in. The Size of such a small Case is evident ·, and
must be stelias that the Balance suspended on its
Support‚ miy he convenit-ntly placed and turned in'
it. The W in dows of the right, lc ·‚ft and fore Sides
ot it, must be made in suc h Manner,th;1tthcy may
be ope ne d and shut without anyg oreat lhaking of the
Case . The Bafis of it must be a Draw, two Inches
high, equal in Breadth to the Cast, jutting out in the
fore Part four or five Inches beyond the Front of it,
and easy to be drawn out and thrust in again. In
this Draw you must put the Weights‚ inclosed in
their little Partitions, a small Pair of Pincers, a small
Shovel, or a Spoon, wherewith to pun: the Powders
irto the small Disties of the Scale 3, and other Things
if any are requifite: By which Means, you will have
all the se Instruments at hand, and keep them perfeffly

clean (Se ePlat. V. Fig. VII.)

257. The Appen atus we have hitherto described
(ᾖα 63-2 66), isdisposed for use in the following Man·
