every common Lead-ore. But this may be diffipated
by roasting. (See Part I. §464.) And as this Ore
crackles‚ the Veffel must be covered in the Beginning
of the Roasting. However let not the Veffel grow
quite red hot, but only of a dari< red Colour: For
this Ore easily grows clammy, and the Vessel, by
Corrosion, adheres so strongly to it, that it cannot
be taken off without Loss. This Sulphur may also
be separated without roasting‚ by Filings oi Cop-
per, when it rnelts on the Fire: but as some Lead-
ores are charged with a semimetallick and chiefly
antimonial Substance‚ which must likewise be sepa-
rated from the Lead with Iron, it is better to let the
Roasting precede: For Iron mixt with mineral Sul-
phur has no Action upon a Semimetal ; but joints it-
self only to it·‚ which we see from any Fufion of
Iron made of crude Antimony‚ in which the Iron'
absol-bs the Sulphur, and lets the reguline Substance
sink to the Bottom. The Fear of those is altoge-
thergroundless, who imagine that Lead is spoiled
by adding Iron to it; for, there is no Method known,
wheteby any Particle of Iron can be made to remain
in Lead reduced into a metallick Forrn, as it i}
constantly and altogether rejected by it. (See Part
Ι. 2.

§Nix {dre you here to have any Regard to the re-
frastory Qiality of Iron ς because when it melts to-
gether with the Substances which it ought to absorb,
it does it as soon as the Flux is added 3 and though.
it should not mest, the Lead may nevertheless be.
precipitated ς because it does not in this Case adhere
to the Interstices of the Iron.

2. But as the Phlogiston is diffipated out of the
Ore during the Roasting, there remains a Matter that
will turn into Glass with Fire alone: Therefore‚
something must bc added that may supply the Place
of the Phlogistou, such :is the black Flux. (Part I.
Ξ 93. 162.) To this you must add moreover Glass-
gall, that will bring to a quicker Fufion the black
Isim: which is refrac‘tc-ry enough with regard 1to tim
