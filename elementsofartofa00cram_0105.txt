Scholion. In determining the inwczrd Fz'gure of the
Furnaces which are employed to carry the Fire to the
hzghest Degree of Strength, you must not be so strillly
exa& z'n giving it such a figure, as that the rcflell‘ed Rays

Line. For the Matter wherewilh the Furnaces are

lined within, can never affitme so snwolh a Figura· : Nay,

Rczys of the Fire cast by the θοαῖς, clo not fall wilh the

strongly enough upon its Snbjebl : For which Purpose
some Sors of C over must be added.

scribed, are sufficient for the perforrning of docimas-
tical Operations striffly so called. But the Affayer
must also perform other Operations, subservient to
