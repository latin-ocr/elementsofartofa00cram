124 The ΛΒΤ· of

Art ·‚ we may now understand and explain the Nature
of those Rhenes, which being composed of the forego-
ing, are found natural in the foffile Kingdom. The
Knowledge of these, though we could hitherto give
it only historically, has nevertheless a vast Utility in
the exercifing the practica] Part of Affaying3 for he
that is well imbued with it before-hand, may very
well dispense with many vague Experiments, which
he is obliged to go through, when altogether a
Stranger to the several natural compound Bodies.

306. But the useless Descriptions given by many
AuthorS, and derived most of them from accidental
Properties 3 the Difficulty of obtaining the best Speci-
mens from different Countries ·‚ the Variety with
which Minerals are mixt together in their minutest
Particles (ξ 32)·, in ihort the Difference ostheWorks
of Nature, and of those of Art, though they are made
of the same Principles united in equal Proportions 3
render this Part of natural History equally difficolt
and defective. Add to these the Variety of outward
Figure3‚ wherein Nature seems to delight still more
in the mineral, than in the vegetative and the animal
KingdomS.

307, Nor is the specifick Gravity of any great
Help‚ in the distinguilhing of compound Minerals.
For, 1. when more than two Bodies of different spe-
cifick Gravities are mixt together, you can dete&
nothing by an hydrostatical Calculation ·, because a
c'ompound Mass of the same specifick Gravsty, may*
be produced by many simple Bodies, very different
from each other, and inixt in a thousand different
Proportions z Now the same is in reality found in the
mineral Kingdmn, as is shewn by docimastical Ope-
rations. 2. The accidental Matters inherent to Mi-
nerals, and the very Air imprisoned in the small Ca-
vities and Clefts of several Ores, hinder. an exaft
Ponderation, and now and then render it very diffi-
cult. 3. The [imple Stones, which being joined with
almost all compound Minemls, are not only of infi-

nite Variety, as to their specifick Weight, but somer
