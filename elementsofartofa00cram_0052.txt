regenerated, which does not dissolve Βορρᾶν so much
as Aqua Fortis does: But if there is no Coppem the
Colour vanishes entirely.

124. Aqua Fortis thus prepared (ᾗ 1 13. and 117.)
and corrected (ᾗ 122.) must be concentrated to a cer-
tain Degree: For if it is too weak, it either retards
the Diffolution‚ or often does not even affeet the
Silver. If on the contrary it is too strong, it va-
niffies into Fumes, which rush violently out of the
Vcffffls, though sufficiently deep, hurrying part of
the Silver along with them : But if there is any thing
of Gold in the Silmr, it is corrodcd into a Dzfi, the
perse& Colleffion of which is afterwards very difficult.
The first Fault is remedied‚ by pouring the Aqua
Fortis into a deeper Cucurbite‚ and by abstraffing
Phlegon out: of it, over a gentle Fire, till you see
yellowish Fumes appear. But, to find out whether it
is too strong, you are to use the following Method.
Melt together one Part of Golcl and four Parts of
Silver 3 of which make a Phae, which you are to cut
into three or more Parts 3 roll up each Part, that it
may more conveniently be introduced into a smalI
Cucurbite: WVhen rolled up, and ssIghtly heated at
the Fire, put this small Plate into the said Cucur-
bite‚ pour upon it Aqua Furlz's, about the Triple of
the VVeight of the Metal, and put it on a gentle Fire :
If then the Silver is eroded fron] the Gelai, so that the
Gold remaining retains the very same Figure of the
1³1³oe rolled up, and there appears no reddish Dust at
the Bottorn of the Veffel, then the Aqua Fortis has
its proper Degree of Strength ε But if the Dissolution
has been made with so much Violence, that the Pow-
der of the Gala? was eroded, or the Plate almost
broken, the qum Fortis is too strong. You must
then, in this Case, dilute it with one tenth or eighth
Part of pure 'Water⁹ or rather of weaker Aqua Fortis,
if you have it at hand, or of the Phlegm that was
drawn from it: Which done, you must repeat the
Trial of the Diffolution of a like finan Plate‚ several

Times over, till the Silver be diffolved without tbi
