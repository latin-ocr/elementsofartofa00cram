234. If then an Operation is to be made in ,ius
Furnace hitherto described (ᾗ 232, 233), you nust
let through the four lower Holes above described,
of the Furnace (See Plat. III. Fzg. I. 0 ο) placed
before and behind, and direffly opposite to each other,
two iton-Bars one Inch thick, and long enough that
their Extreniities on every Side may jut out of the
Holes a small Matter. These serve to support the
Muffel, and its Bottom (See Plat. III. Fig. Ill. and
I'V). You then introduce the Muffel through the
upper Aperture of the Furnace (Fig. Ι. d.) and place
thern upon the above described ison-Bars, in such
Manner that the open fore-side of it be contiguous to
the inward Boi-der of the upper Door f. (See Fig,
III. and IV). The Fuel of the Fire is introduced
through the Top of the Furnace (d) 3 the Cover of
which, on this Armant, must be moveable, and not
very heavy (q), The best Fuel for the Fire is Char-
coal made of the hardest Wood‚ especially of Beech,
N broken irito small Pieces of the Bigness of an Inch,
wherewith the Muffel must be covered over some In-
ches high ³2. We then reject larger bits of Coals,
because they cannot fall through the narrovv Interstices,
between the Sides of the Muffel and those ofthe Fur—
nace‚ and cannot of course sufficiently surround the
Circumference of the Muffel : Whence it happen3‚
that there are on every Side places void of Fuel, and ’
the Fire is either not strong enough, or unequal.
But, if on the contrary, you use Coals too small ·‚
then a great Part fall immediately through the Inter-
stices of the Grate into the Ash-hole ; and the ten-
derest Particles of them turn too soon into Ashes, and
by increafing the Heap of Afhes, obstruet the free

sIJDraught of the Air, which is here greatly requi-
te.

*² Scotch Coal or Kennel—Coal (but not Nem-Castle or Sea-Coal) bro-
ken into small Preces, may be mixed with an equal Qantity of
Charcoal3 or if any Orc-s require long roasting, the Fire may be first
kinuled with Scotch Coal3 but the operation is best finisstcd With
onlyCharcoal.
