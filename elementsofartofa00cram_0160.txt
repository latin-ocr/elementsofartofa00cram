142 The ART of

them nothing at all of their Weight, by being burne
in the Fire Nor does 1t seem probable, thagt there
is any‘ Antimony hidden 1n all these Minerals. But
what makes this Matter rnore obscure is, that the
Blood— stone, red Chalk‚ and some other iron- Ores,

without adding any phlogistical Matter to them, are
rendered capable of yielding to the fnagnetick Vir-

tue, by being only made red hot in a Veffel well
closed·, while, on the cpntriry, the other Bodies‚

when made red hot, require the Addition of a more
fixt Phlogiston, without which the Load- stone would
have either no Iron at .1.1, or a much less Qantity
of it to attraft. On this Account‚ there have be en
two Opinions esnoused by Authors Some are of
Opini0n‚ that mineral Su1phur, and the Acids adher-
ing to Iron, hinder it from being attracted by the
Load-stone ς and that consequently they must either
be diffipated or changed, to restore to Iron its mag-
netick Virtue. But it is repugnant to their being
diffipated, that some Ores made red hot in close Ves—
sels, without any Addition‚ and losing not the least
Part of their Weight thereby‚ yet become capable of
being attracted by the Load-stone ·, as it is repugnant
to their being changed, that mineral Sulphur, and
its Acid, are never altered in close Veffels, by Fire
alone, without any Addition3 and that on the con-

trary the sulphureous Acid, with an Addition ofa true
Phlogiston, regenerates the true mineral Sulphur‚

which nevert'neless 13 supposed to refist the Aetion of
the Load- stone. Now the Phlogiston made red hot
with imn-Ores, is very proper to revive the Attraeti-

bility: Nor can this be any way obtained, when the
Ustulation is made with pure alkaline Substances,
that really change the Acid of Sulphur. The other
Opinion, taken from the Decifions of the illustrious
Mr. St'hal³ is, that Iron is ingendered by a Phlo-

giston‚ rnixt with a ferruginous Earth‚ by Means of
Ustulation: which will appear the more probable‚ if
you attend to the following Considerations. 1. The
