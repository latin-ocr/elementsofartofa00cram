partly, or intirely by pot-Albes, volatile and urinous
Salts. In sswrt‚ a Precipitation is also made by pour· „
ing such Things, as cannot dissolve the Body in hand,
either alone, or joined to a Menstruum that contains
the said ssody, or at least dissolve it in another Man-
ner‚ or even in a leffer Quantity‚ than if the Men·
struum had at first been used pure. In the first Case,
a total Precipitation is performed, as may beseen in
the Precipitation of Silver out of Aqua Fortis, made
by Spirit of Salt. In the second Cast, a great De-
turbation and Precipitation is made3 but a second
Solution soon follows ε As it happens, when Iron be·
ing diffolved in Aqua Fortis, you add to it in a pro-
per Mamer, a Liquor perfeffly clear from alkaline
fixt Salt: but then there remains most commonly a
certain Part, which is not perfectly dissolved a second
Time. In the third Case, there is but a partial
Precipitation made: You will have an Instance of
this, if Mercury diffolved in Aqua Fortis saturated
with it, is precipitated by* common or ammoniae
Salt‚ or by their aeid Spirit. A PrecipitatIOn is also
sometimes made by adding only a Qantity of Water
to dilute: Such is that made with Regulus Antimonii,
diffolved in Spirit of marine San, or in Aqua Regis .·
For these Menstrua do not dissolve this semi-Metal,
unless they are concentrated.

478. All this Precipitation (§ 477.) is helped on
by a moderate Heat ς by Means of which the preci-
pitating Body enters more easily into the Menstruum.
Then‚ you must have a considerable Quantity of Wa-
ter to dilute with, except in the first Kind of Preci-
pitation ε For most commonly, the more concentrated
DiffolutionS, assume the Confistence of a Paste, so
soon as the precipitating Body is added to thema
