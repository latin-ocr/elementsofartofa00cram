Glasi. But the best Bones are those of Calves‚ Oxen,
Sheep and Horses‚ especially the stnassest, which are
the more easlly calcined‚ the longer they have been
exposed to the Injuries of the Air.

170. The Calcination of these Bones (ᾗ 169.) must
be made for a few Hours, or more, according to their
Biwess, in a great open F ire : Therefore, you must
picci< up the smaller one3‚ and those which are less
covered with fat. You will have a sure Sign of the
Calcination's being perfect, if you see not one black
Spot without the Bones, nor any within when you
break them.

171. When these Bones are perfectly white (ξ 170),
pound them in a Mortar, sift them through a very
fine Sieve 3 or if you have none of this Kind at hand,
grind the coarser Powder upon a very hard Stone into
a very fine Flour, and then wash it with warni frelh
Water: For during the Calcination, the Bones are
almost always impregnated with the Salt ofthe Ashes
of the Fewel of t-he Fire. Then this will be an ex-
cellent Earth for the making of Coppels ἕξ.

172. Filh-bones, when very small, are more easily
calcined than those of other Animals: Which may
be eafily done in a large open Earthen Veffel. These
Bones being then pulverized are still better than the
foregoing (§ 171).

173. Parget or Plaster made of some kinds of
Spaad‚ is almost preferable to the aforesaid Earths
(§ 171, 172). But it is not every Spaad will serve
this Purpose. You must then, before you prepare a
Quantity of this Parget‚ previoussy try whether it ³
will succeed‚ or not. The Calcination of this Kind of
Spaad is made in an earthen Vefi'eh closed with a
Tile upon a gentle Fire: This occasions a little

'crackling, which being over, the Calcination is per-

seq-74· But, as the Preparation of the Ashes of Bones

, is toilsome enough (ᾗ 171, 172) ς and the said Kinds

of Spaad not to be found every where 3 on this Ac-
