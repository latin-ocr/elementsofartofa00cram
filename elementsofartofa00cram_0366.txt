340 The ΑΜ· of

Iron, that comes out of the Ore, brittle, and, the latter
⁴not only does the same, but being managed in aclose
Veffel, with a saline alkaline Flux, turns to Liver
of Sulphur, to the Affion of which Iron yielding in
every Respect, it can upon no Account be precipitated‚
and, if not the whole, a great Part of it, at least, is
retained by the sulphureous Scoria ς so that in this
Case, you will most commonly look in vain fora Re-
gulus. See the Effe& of the IngredientS, of which
the Flux is composed (Part I. ᾗ 164).

2. The Iron which is obtained from this first Pre-
cipitation, has hardly ever the requisite Duffility3
but is rather brittle : The Reason of which iS‚ that
the Sulphur and Arsenick remain in it. It is true,
when a Vein of Iron is roasted, if it abounds in both
these Matters, it looses the greatest Part of them,
and even the more so, as the Ore is less disposed to
melting: But, some Part of them seems to be so
strictly inherent in the Ore, that it can never be sepa·
rated, but with absorbent, terrestrial, alkaline In-
gredients, that change the Nature of the Sulphur:
For this Reason, in a larger Operation, they add
quick-Lime, or marble Stones that turn into an acrid
Calx, which, while they absorb the said MineraIS‚
are by it, and by the Help of the destroyed Part of
the Iron, brought to a Fufion, and turn to a vitri·
fied Scoria; though, at other Times, they res1st so
much by their own Nature a Vitrification. Another
cause of the Brittleness of Iron is the unmetalliclt
Earth, when it is not yet separated from it : For the
iron—Ore contains a great Qlantity of it, and in the
melting remains joined with the reguline Part z
Whence the Iton is rendered very coarse and brittle.

theless, the Regulus’s produced out of thern, when
broken, have sometimesa neat semi—metallick Look:
Which proceeds undoubtedly from-a Mixture of a
small antity of some other Metal or semi—Metal,
