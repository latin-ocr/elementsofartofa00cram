belong to this Article. For Gold, as well as Silver,
is free from the Aetion of Ι ead and Glass of Lead,
and sustains the Coppel and the Test, in which all
the other Bodies turn to Scoria' s. Therefore, Gold
mixt with Silver is collefted in the very same Process
by which the said Silver is separated stom its Ores ε
as we have already mentioned several Times, in the
foregoing ChapterS. Amalgamation itself is more
proper to Gold than to Silver3 that is, as they are
both separated. from their Matrixs by this Operation z
For there is no Metal, that is not more frequently
met with in a State of Ore, than in its metallick
State : But Gold, is always found in a true metallici<
State ; unless its Qantity is many Times inferior to
that of the Silver adherent together with it in the
same Matrix. But Gold, even in this Case, cannot
always be said to be in a State of Ore (See Part Ι.
5400). Now, a true metallick State is required for
an Amalgamation ; because no Extraction can other·—
wise be made by Mercury.

There is indeed a great many Proceffes recommend-

ed by several Artificers, for the extraffing of Gold ·

out of its Matrix 3 and by which they say that you
will obtain more than by the ordinary Method : But
they, for the most Part, are so trifling and so tedious
in the Work, that they hardly deserve to be described,
so far they are from being worthy to be imitated. The
mostcommon of them are those, in which the Ore is
prepared by roasting ·, which must not be always neg-³
lefted3 as it is sometimes altogether neceffary. But to
repeat it so many Times over, to extinguish the Ore
after each roasting in Urine of Children, or in other
Lies prepared in a particular Manner, then to scorify
it first in a Crucible with Lead and other Ingredients,
and afterwards to put it in a Test to scorify it a second
Time, and so on, is a Method as filly as it is toil-
sorne3 by which Gold is rather diffipated than it is

collected.
