rent Times put upon any Gold of any Allay what-
ever, has a very small Qantity of Silver in it:
Therefore‚ being hardly different from crude Anti-
mony, if you mix it with fresh crude Antimony‚ it
may again serve for the same Operation&

PROCESS XXVIII.
Precipitation of Gold by Faston (Part I. ᾗ 466.) out cf

a Mixture eight Carats zzs‘sscler Stamiard.

F the Qantity of the Gold in a Max-1< of the

Minore, does not exceed three or four Caram,
it is not convenient to make a Cementation‚ nor a
Separation by Aqua Fortis, nor a Preeipitation by
crude Antimony : Which is sels-evident, to any who
considers the Nature of these Operations‚ and the
neceffary Expences which attend them. Therefore‚
another Method must be used. Likewise, if you
happen to have a Mixture of five, fix, or seven
Caram, fit to make a Separation by Aqua Fortis ·,
you may perform the Separation the dry Way, when
particular Circumstances will not admit of the fore-
going Method.

APPARATUS.

1. Find out by the Experiment of Proc. XXII,
or by the Touch-stone, first, whether there is in the
Mixture a Qantity of Gold sufficient to pay the
Charges of the Separation, and whether it does not
exeeed three or four Carats. This being found out,
granulate the whole Mixture which is to go through
the Operation. Weigh half a Mark of the Grains
dried‚ and then examine again the Proportion of the.
Gold and Silver, by an accurate Coppelling and Se-
paration in Aqua Fortis (Proc. XXV.) This you do
in order to know, whether all the Gold has been pree
cipitated out of the Silvelr in the following Opera-
