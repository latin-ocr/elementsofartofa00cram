394 The ΛΚΤ of

outward Forms : Otherwise, Arsenick is but one and
the same, so it be but pure, When perfectly pure,
it is of a white Colour : When joined with a Phlo-
giston, it becomes of a grey, blackish, alh-colour ε
And this is true not only of sublimed‚ but also of
native Arsenick: As it is plain in the native black
Arsenick‚ called in German fflrbmattnnssfligensttin,
out of which a grey Kind ofArsenick is produced by
Sublimation. Arsenick sublimed with mineral Sul-
phur, is always of an orange, yellow, or red Colour.
But the Phlogiston is easily detected in Arsenick both
sublimed and native, when you reduce this to Pow-
der, and cast it upon Nitre melted in a Crucibvle:
*For then you see a bright Flame and Detonation,
which is produced by the least Qantity of any Kind
of Phlogiston whatever, mixt with Nitre. They,
indeed say, that Nitre detonates with Arsenick 3 that
it produces a Flame, and that then the blue Spirit of
Nitre of Stahl is expelled at the same Time: But
pure, white, crystalline Arsenick, gives no Flame
with Nitre ·‚ though it has the other Proper-ties men-
tioned. You must make the Experiment about this
Manet, with the following Precautions. Reduce a
few Ounces of the purest Nitre into Powder‚ and
*put it into a deep wide Crucible : Put the Crucible in-
toa wind-Furnace, and add gradually hot burning
Coals that have ceased to crackle, lest the Vessel be
split ς nor must these Coals be heaped up higher than ·
half the Height of the Crucible, which, mean while,
must be covered against the Fall of burning Coals¹
into it: When the Nitre melts in such a Degree of
F ire as makes it grow moderately red, add at several⁴ ’
Times Powder made with a solid Bit of white crys-
talline Arsenick : A noisy Ebullition is immediately
produced, so that sometimes the foaming Nitre runs
over a large Veffel ·, a F ume is emitted which is ar-
senical at first , and afterwards perfectly of the smell
of Aqua Fortis ; which being received through a hol-
low Retort into a Glass Recipient applied to it, re-

sembles much the penetrating Spirit of Nitre. Yostu
