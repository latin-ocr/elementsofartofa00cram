Sulfhuris, whether and how much Tartar vitriolate
it contains ·‚ which is found out by Edulcoration with
warm Water, and by the Diminnrion thus made in
the Weight of the dried Refidue ·‚ because the Tar-
tar vitriolate being already produced in the Liver of
Sulphur‚ would remain with the Lac Sulphurh, in
the filtrating Paper, as a Salt very difficult to be dis-
solved: Therefore, as much Acid as is adherent to
such a VVeight of Tartar vitriolate, so much are you
to substract from the Increase of the Weight.

5. Mineral Sulphur may be produced by Art se-
veral Ways, out of any Acid and Phlogiston what-
ever. This is most conveniently performed by Stahl's
Method, as follows: Mix with Tartar vitriolate‚
in order to facilitate the Melting of the refra&0ry
Salt, an equal Weight of Pot-ash, to which you
must ssightly mix one eighth Part of soft pulve-
rized Charcoal. Put this Mixture at several Times
into a red-hot Cruciffle, which must be covered with
a Tile, lesta great Quantity of the Phlogiston should
be diffipated by the Fire. The Mixture wiil meir,
and Liver of Sulphur, all the Principles of which
are present, will soon be produced: When this is
diffolved in Water‚ Lac Sulphuris may next be pre-
cipitated outof it, and this be sublimed into pei-”fest
Flowers of Sulphur ³¹⁶.
