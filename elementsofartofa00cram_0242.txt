ent, it may be compensated by the Violence of the
Fire: Which being neglefted, the Regulus of the
remaining Silver hardening too soon, a Part of the
’ Lead preserved from its Destrufflon by the Silver,
remains joined to it. Such a residuous Part of Lead
adhering to the Silver, is called in German 21512131
rath.

4. The Operation of coppelling being done, the
Grain or Bead of Silver must be taken out of the
Fire with all Speed ; lest growing eold, it should be
conglutinated to the Coppel by the Litharge: For
otherwise, it can hardly be taken off, without Part
of the Coppel adhering to it. The Coppel may also
be left a While with its Bead under the Muffel, and
this is better ·, that all the Litharge may retire into
the Coppel: For then it is very easily taken out.
As for the rest, you may see Part 1. §181.C0r0ll.
The Operation of Coppelling being duly perfected,
the Bead of Silver will be full of small Cavities un-
derneath.

5. By these two Proeeffes (Ι. and ΙΙ.) is com-
pleated the docimastick Examination ofa fufible Ore,
whereby it appears how much Silver may be fetched
out of it with Benefit, by a metallurgical Operation :
For both being joined, answet· exac'tly to the great
Operations of Metallurgy. There are some of these
Operations, which those that are well versed in the
Matter, can perform together, at once, and under
the sime Muffel ·‚ provided one Veffel is no Impedi-
ment to the other. At least the Coppel may be con-
veniently heated, atone and the same Time, and in
the sanie Fire, while the Scorification is performed in
the Test.

6. There is no Lead sold, but contains some
Silver : For it is not always worth the Charges of se-
parating it. Such a little Mass of Silver most conig
monly is one or two Draehms in every Centner of
Lem. Therefore, it occasions a very great Error,
when it is left in the Coppel, and joins to the Regu-
