fame Manner as the other Metals and Semi-metals‚
by being exposed to a melting F ire. Nor has any
Method hitherto been invented, or communicated at
least by the Inventor, whereby the Flowers of Zink
may be reduced to a semi-metallici< State: Since
they rather are fixt so far in the F ire, as to be vitri-
fied with F luxes.

na-ted with none or at least very little Phlogist0n‚
you may obtain out of them, lshall not say, reduce
from them, a few Grains of Zink‚ For Instance, if you
mixt by Trition the Flowers just mentioned, with
Glass—gall‚ or the caustick alkaline Salt which is pre-
pared out of the inspiffated Lye of Pot-ashes and
Qick-lime‚ and expose them in a Crucible, to a
x Fire not greater than is neceffary to melt the Salt
well, and then take them presently out of the Fire,
and fling the Crucible with the Salt grown cold into
a clean Bason full of warm Water‚ you will find,
after having washed off the Salt and the lightest
Dross, a few and very small Grains of Zink‚ most
commonly covered with yellow Crusts, precipitated
here and there at the Bottom os the Veffel, and not
to be collected without a tedious Labour. These
Grains of Zink‚ if not pretty large, hardly melt in-
to a Regulus, but peristi intirely, being resolved by
the Fire into small Flames and Flowers. But, you
must not for this Purpose use the black or the white
Flux, because they require so great a Fire to be
melted, that the small and widely dispersed Particles
of the Zink‚ are burnt much sooner, than they can
be precipitated by the concomitant Matters melted
sufficiently thin ε Which is very plain from the small
coloured Flames and F lowers that break forth. Nor
does the above-mentioned very acrid Salt bear the
Addition of a Phlogiston ·‚ nay, when already
melted, if you add the least Fat to it, it immediately
grows solid, and requires a F ire equally strong as the
black F lux doeS, to be brought again to a State of
