The Uft and Reasons of the Process.

ι. Among all Met-als, and all the Minerals which
are separated from Gold and Silver by Lead, Copper
is the only one that remains joined to the refidous
Regulus of Lead after the Scorification, and is fit to
undergo the Coppelling : For the others either are not
at all received by Lead‚ or if they are, it reiee'ts and

destroys them before the Scorification ·, or, if they =

remain united with the Lead, they split and corrode
the Coppels. The Coppels are also eafily split, es-
pecially the larger Ones,when you put Lead into them
before they are quite red-hot.

2. The Scoria which is produced during this Pro-
cess is indeed that common Litharge, which is sold ε
It is a Text-ure of small scaly Lamina’s looking like
Chr-omer, and ifyou break it, it refists like other Li-
tharge‚ by a certain Toughness.

3. There is no Metal but Copper alone, that melts
together with Lead into one Mass, and dies the Cop-
pels with a blackifh Colour. Therefore‚ when you
see this, yon may safely conclude, that there is Cop-
per in the Lead.
