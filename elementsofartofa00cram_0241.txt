prevented, by a large Coal that closes the whole Ca-
vity of the Coppel, when put upon it like a Tile:
But, as this Dese& is observed before it can be reme-
died, on this very Account‚ an exa& Assayer can
never trust to such a Process. Befides, the Opera-
tion is also retarded by this Remedy: For scorified
Lead, is often reduced by the Phlogiston of the Coal ;
wherefore this must be removed so soon as the Lead
begins to rest. It also sometimes happens, when you
neglect to heac the Coppel sufficiently‚ that the
Lead continually quivers in the Coppe13 so that it
never settles 3 ancl thus changingits Placet, it now and
then is in Part thrown out of the Coppel. This
Fault may be better prevented‚ by putting a larger

the Silver ihould be carried away, by the too atte-
nuated Litharge‚ and by the Smoke itself of the
Lead: For in every dry, as well as moist and too
turbulent Diffipation of the Volaffles, a Part of a
Body howsoever fixt, may at the same Time be hur-
ried away. That degree of Fire is here sufficient,
by which Lead is changed into Lidmrge, and atte-
nuated so far as to be able to penetrate the Coppel.
But when in the End os the Operation‚ the Lead is
almost all consumed, the Fire then must be made
very strong 3 lest something of the Lead ssiould vre-

brittle. For Lead is destroyed into a sufficiently
attenuated Litharge, by a much leffer Fire than is
neceffary to melt pure Silver: And Lead acts here.
