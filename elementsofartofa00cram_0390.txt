mineral Sulphur3 for this Reason the minerai Su}-
phur is not intirely consumed ε And if it were, the
Acid of it detained by the alcaline fixt Salt: here pro-
duced with it, and joined with the Phlogiston of the
Tartar, would nevertheless make a copious Hepar
Sulphuris‚ whereby a great Deal of the Regulus would
be retained. This appears evidently, if you add to
the Scoria half its Qantity of Filings of Iron, and
melt it a second Time: For then, the Regulus re—
maining in the Scoria, will subfide to the Bottom of
the Cone. Likewffe, a great Deal of Sulphur Aura-
tum is precipitated‚ if this Scoria is edulcorated with
warm Water‚ and Vinegar poured upon the Diffolu-
tion. A great Qantity of reducible Flowers is also
rejefted during the Detonation. And as the Mixture
must be put at several Timessinto the Fire, and must
be left the longer in it, the Veffel being mean while
open 3 a great Deal of this volatile Semi-metal is
consumed, and on this Account‚ there remains but
a very small Part of the Regulus, at the Bottom of

the melting Cone.

APPARATUS.

1. U T one Part ofIron not rusty into a Crucible

made thoroughly white-hot in a Wind Fur-
nace. But you must chuse Bits of Iron not very
thick, for Instance, small Plates, Nails, or even
fresh Filings. When the Iron is perfeffly white-hot,
add to it, the double Qantity of crude Antimony
at several Times, lest the Veffel should break asun-
’ der by the too sudden Application of a cold Body:
You will see your Iron diffolved by the melted Anti-

mony: This done, add to it at different Tirans·9 οἱ
