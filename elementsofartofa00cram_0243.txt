ASSAYING METALS. '217

For which Reason, this increasmg of Silver is always
substracted by all accurate Affayers. Therefore‚ a
confiderable Qantity of Lead is granulated at once
for this Purpose‚ and well mixt by fifting: Then
this granulated Metal alone, must be tried in a Cop-
pel, in the same Qantity used to make the Trial of
Ores·, that you may have separately the Bead of Sil-
ver it contains. For this, while the Regulus of Sil-
ver, 'separated from the Ore by the same Kind of
Lead, is weighing, is put into the other Scale which
contains the 'Weight 3 to take away the Overplus of
WVeight, that was added to this Regulus, by the
same Qantity of the Lead imployed for the Scorifi-
cation and Coppelling. But whenever a Granula-
tion of new Lead is made, the determined Qantiries
of it commonly imployed for the trying of Ores,
must be as many Times tried in the Coppel; even
though you knew, that the Lead had also been digged
out of the same Mine as the first, and melted out of
its Ore in the same Manner. For while Lead is
roasted, Silver is not very equally distributed through
it: Which proceeds from many Cwses, of which
hereafter.

such Operatione, must be tried, to know whether
they let any Sil-wer fall into the Regulus of Lm, and
how much. For the Litharge itself is sometimes
loaded with Silver. Therefore, it is proper to try
it itself in the Coppel, or the Glass of Lead made
out of it, before they are imployed. Copper, Iron,
and other Metals‚ are seldorn altogether destitute of
Silver z And though they contain so little of it, that
the Error proceeding therefrom is hardly sensible3
nevertheless, you must beware of the minutest Mi-
stakes : For a great Number of them, though ever
·so infignificant, constitute, when collec‘ted together,
an Error, which is not inconfiderable.
