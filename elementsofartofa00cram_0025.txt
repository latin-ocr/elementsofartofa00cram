ofthern will fill a large Veffel, and then turn into a
very spongy and light Mass, that swims upon Water.

Νο 2. Common Potter's Clay is heavy, and'of a
whitish blue Colour·‚ in Water it sostens into a tena-
eious Paste3 a middling Fire hardens it first, and a
stronger Fire at last runs it into a Glass of a dark
green Colour.

N ⁰ 3. The Boles and Terroe Sag-illam or ftaled Earths,
have an Affinity (N0 2.) with the foregoing, but are
ofa fatter Nature, and of different ColourS. They
harden to such a Degree in a moderate melting Fire,
that they most commonly give Sparkles, when struck
with a Flint; in a stronger Fire, they turn into
Glass, partly solid and green, and partly spungy and
light, (as ΝΟ. 1.) To this Class belong a lew Earths
of the Nature of Marle, though not quite so fat.

Νο 4. Flint, which is a vastly ponderous Stone,
when struck with a Steel gives very bright Sparkles,
which being examined with the Microscope, prove
to be Scor-ise of melted Iron and Stone. It is infinite-
ly hard, and ofa great many Colours. It assumes a
multitude ofdisferent Names, according to the Varie-
ty ofits Colour, for the Beauty of which it is very
,much valued, though in consideration of its Size itis
sometimes of no Price at all. If this Stone, either
in its natural Surfnce, or when broken, is very cutting
and full of Angles, it is called by the Miners ,ertz .-
Some ofthem are eafily put in Fufion in a wind Fur-
nace3 others resist the greatest Fire without hardly
any Alter-arion, and might bg thought not to belong
to this Class·, but by means of a small Qantity of
Salt, or some other Menstruum, nay by means of the
Alkalz' in the Coals they will melt in a naked Fire.
When they are only minute Flints like Gndns, heap-
ed together, but not adhering to each other, they are
called Sand or Gravel. But when they stit-l< together,
though distinffly collected, they are called a sandy
or gravelly Stone, which is ofthe same Nature as the
Flint, and affumes in the Fire a Variety of CoIours,

Forms, and Delicacy. L·
