not succeed in the present Case: for Iron, that may
be mixt with Copper while it precipitates it, mixes
in great Part with the precipitated Copper. For,
according to the most accurate Experience‚ the pre-
cipitated participates of the precipitating Body, if
not in all, at least in a great many Precipitation33
and this happens in the moist as well as in the dry
ones·‚ Nevertheless‚ this happens sometimes more,
sometimes less,

PROCESS XLIII.

T he further Purification of the Regulus’s ofl'roc. XLI.
and XLII, to make Black Coppcr.

APPARATUS.-

E T the Regulus be beaten to a coarse Powder,

and be roasted and comminuted several Times
over, that the Sulphur and Arsenick may be diffipated
(Prae. XXXIX.): Theo, let it be reduced with the
black Flux (Proc. XL.) or by Stratification with
Coals, The Regulus thereby produced wil} be like
that of Proc. XL.

The Use and R eqfws of the Procaefss.

1. As the Regulus’s of the foregoing Proceffes‚ are
made of the Particles of the Pyrites melted together,
with this only Atteration in the Proportion of the ln-
gredients‚ that there is less Sulphurand Arsenick‚ and
less alsoof the subtil unmetallick Earth in the Regulus's
than there was in the Pyrites out of w11Ich they have
been produced (Proc. XLI. ΝΟ. 3.): lt is neceffary to
make previous Roastings by the same Methods that
were prescribed Proc. XXXIX, to make the black
(joppes so called Proc. XL. Nay, one or two Fu-
srons must sometimes precede the Roastings, when the
Rf'gulus’s are very course, and tamted with a great
Qantity of hom that the Iron may, by a repeated
