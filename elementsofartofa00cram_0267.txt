immediately with a dry Stick half-burnt ; that 'they
may all be well mixt together: Leave them so for
about one Minute ς then stir them ‘again for the last
Time, and throw into them a small Bit of Paper
folded up, and rubbed with Wax or Tallow ἐ And
while it burns with a clear Flame‚ po‘ur the whole
Mass'at one Stream into the Moulds (Part I. Plat. II.
Eg. XX), placed quite horizontal, and rubbed with
Tallow; and let this grow cold of itself, together
with the Mass therein contained. But the Mass ta·
ken afterwards out of the Mould3‚ and commonly
called Ingot, as is also the Cone itself(Part Ι. § 223),
must be smooth‚ solid, and of an equal Thickness all
round: But if it appears rough, and the Infide of the
Crucible (as far as the Mass has touched it during the
melting and the pouring out) is seen covered with a
metallick Skin‚ it isa Sign that the Fire hasbeen
defective: And consequently an equal Mixture has
not been obtained. Belides, a Fire too great and
continued too long, produces a Scoria sometimes so-
lid, sometimes spongy, full of Bubbles‚ covering the

Mass here and there when it has been poured out and .

cooled, or insinuatihg itself deeper into it, while it is
pouring out t If this be the Case, the Process must
be repeated. If the Mass is in good Condidon,
scour it well with coal-Dust‚ and weigh it, to know
how much of its Substance has been lost. Then cut
off from it a Bit, in the Place which is distant one
quarter Part of the Length of the whole Mass from
each Extremity‚ in such Manner however, that the
Mass may at the same Time be divided by a trans·
versal Sefflon. This done, substra& as much from
the Centner or docimastical Mark, as all the Speci-
mens cut off from the Regulus's, and weighed toge-
ther before the Fufion, have lost of their Weightz
Let the rest go for an intire Centner or docimastical
Mark, and with a Fiie make the Specimen‚ which
you have cut off from the Mass of the bigot, equal
to it. However, take care not to serape off any
Thing from another Place, excePt from the two ἕατ’-
