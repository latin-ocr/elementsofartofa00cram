szhe REGULUS OF ANTIMONY αξ, and ils Ore.

404. Ι am not certain from :my Observation‚ that
the pure Regulus of sltitimony was ever fonnd native 3
nor do I remember to have read in any Author‚ of
its having been fetched pure out of the Mine.

405. The Ore of Antimony, is of the Colour of
lead-Ore (ξ 373), it has very fine, long, parallel
Striae, in form of Needles‚ thet cut each other across;
and more seldom small sbining Scales, with a light
reddish Colour intermixed‘, it is heavy‚ and resolves
partly into a Regulus (ξ 16), and common Sulphur,
out of either ofwhich‚ it may likewise be eafily rege-
nerated (ᾗ 333.) by a proper Operation.

Scholion. ‘Ihe Description of the Regulus of Anti-
mony (ξ 404.) hes indeed a very great Affiizity with
the Descriptions which we have given of fhme iren-Ores
(ᾗ 351, 352, 353), especially <§353)·, and there is in-
cleed fi) great a Likeness between them ·‚ that they are
semetimes cmgfhzmdeel wilh one another. Nevertheles5‚ it
is ecisj} to distinguish the Ore of Autimony from the rest,
beadufl> asmall Parin-le cf it applied to the Fire of a
Lamp, will melt immediately ·, which rapacious iron-
Ores cem eilher nothe put at all in Fufion, or at least
not without ustng the blow-Pipe (ᾗ 258). Befides‚ when
a Man'has once exaffly confidered the external Habit of
all these Mines, am] fissled his own Imagination with the
Impreffion of it, he finds out a certain Difference, which
chls camiot eafily deferibe‚ biit which is neverthelefkfh
reinczikable, that he is able for the future to clssieguish
them from each other, by bare lnſjeeHion.

406. Bismuth lies sometimes inelosed so very pure
in its Ore, that you need not use any other Opera·

¹* The common Antimony to be met with in Shops, hath under-
gone a Fufion from its Dte, and therefore oux· Author calls it Regu·
