occafioned, and as many Effeets produced upon the
Obje& 3 though these different Series of Operations‚
do not always answer the intention of the Artificer.
Therefore, as the Change of the Subjetst, which is
our chief Pur-pose, cannot be perfected in the Pro-
cesses by a simple Operation ·, it is evident, that we
cannot here proceecl according to that Series which
we have. given (Part I. §448), in the Ta ,le of
Operations ·, partly, because, in the proceeding, the
greatest Skill confists, in chufing the Operations neces-
sary for the Chz ge proportionably to the Variety
of the Subject, and the Intention, and in compofing
them suitably; which cannot be done, when any
Process is resolved into its fimple Operations‚ and
these afterwards grammatically referred to one and
the same Class ε Partly, because a‘great many che-
mical Operations, not properly belonging to our
Subject, nor even mentioned, are often made use of
in a subfidiary Manner; for Instance, Distillations,
Evaporations, Crystallizations, and the like. For,
in the Explication we are about to give of the doci-
mastical Proceffes, our chief Regard must be, to sa-
tisfy the Understanding rather than the Memory of
Beginners 3 that it may be an easy Matter for them
to imitate the Proceffes explained to them. We gain
the first of these Ends, by giving the first Rank to
those Proceffes, which being of themselves intelligi-
ble, require not the Knowledge of the following,
but are rather of Help, for the better Understanding
of them, or at least suppose nothing of what fol-
lows, that may not immediately be explained in a few
Words, or be understood from what precedes, by
Help of a short Theory. Likewise, those that are
more easy to be done, must as much as poffible be put >
before the more difficult. Then, if many Operations
are required for producing the Effecit, it will be pro-
per to divide the whole Apparatus into some Proceffes,
lest, being so numerous, they should perplex one
another ς and, as much as possible, to consider sepa-

rately the different Changes, after having dedssced
