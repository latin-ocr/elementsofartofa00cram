288 The ΛΒΤ of

ofFilings of Iron not rusty, and of glast-Gall (Part I.
§ 137.) each half a Centner. Beat all these Things in
a Mortar‚ that they may be well mixt together, and
put them immediately into the Crucible‚ or into the
Skillet (Part I. Plat. II. Fig. V, VI, X) having
twice or thrice as much Capacity 3 then cover them
over, a uarter of an Inch thick, with common Salt,
and press thern with your F inger. Shut the Crucible
close with a Tile, or with some other smaller inverted
Crucible, whose Brink may be received into the infe-
rior-one : Stop the Joint with such Lute as may bear
Fire: and then dry the whole at a moderate Heat.
But the Salts must be very dry, and not suffered to
melt by too great a Slowness in the Operation.

3. Put the Crucible into the wind-Furnace (Part I.
§ 240.) and heap Coals upon it, so as that it may be
covered over with them a few Inches high 3 govern
the Fire in such Mamer, that it may first grow
ssightly red hot. Soon after you will hear your common
Salt crackle ·‚ and then there will be a gentle hiffing
Noise: So long as this lasts, keep the same Degree
of Fire, till it is quite over. Then increase suddenly
the F ire, till the whole Mass is melted ε Which may
be done in a Qarter of an Hour, in a moderate
nielting Fire. Take out the Crucible, and put it
upon the Hearth of the Furnace, which must be
very dry ε Strike it a few Times with a Hammer,
that the Lead that may perhaps be dispersed in
Grains at the Bottom of the Vefi'el‚ may run intoa
solid Regulus. When the Crucible is grown cold of
itself, and broken, you will find the Regulus, which
being weighed, will shew how much Lead the Smelt-
ers may tetch out of the Ore. But the Silver, if
there chauces to be any, is by that Means precipi-
tated alone with the Lead, and must be detested at
last by coppelling.

4. You will know that the Operation is happily
performed, if the Scoriae subfide in the Veffel, and
if they do not foam over the Brink of the Veffel,
