us first take for a Bafis one Weight‚ being about two?
¹thirds of a common Drachm, and let it be marked
(64. lh). Then have at hand granulated Lead,
wastred clean, well dried, and fifted very fine z Put
as much of it in one of the small Dilhes of the Affay-
balance, as shall be necessary to equipoise the Weight
(64. lb.) just mentioned, which is in the opposite
small Dish. This done, take out of the Dish the
filver-Weight, and put in the Room of it half of the
granulated Lead ; so that a perfect Equilibrium may
be obtained. Then pour the granulated Lead outof
each small Dish, and instead ofit put another filver-
Weight already made, like the foregoing, being a
little heavier than half of it, and mark it (32. lb.)
taking great Care, that not the minutest Part of the
granulated Lead remain in the small Dish. If this
second filver-Weight exceeds by much that of the
granulated Lead being still in the other finali Diih 3
you must take a little from it, with a delicate thin
File: And if it exceeds it but little, use a small
Whetstone, that will rub off but a little at a time,
comparing your Weights pretty often, till you render
this perfeffly equal to the granulated Lead. Then
interchange the small Dishes; that, if the Balance
has poffibly been vitiated, or any Error committed,
it may neceffarily appear. Go on in the same Man-
ner, till you have made all the small WeightS. But
if you finally will have one entire hundred 3 add to
the Weight 64. ll). One of 32, and another of
4. lib, and taking them together, make one larger
Sil-ver Plate of equal Weight with them, and mark it
(100 lb.) Thus you will have a sufficient Number
of VVeights, out of which you will be able to com-
pose all the Parts of the Hundred, by intermixing
them.

278. You will often want a centner—Weight larger
than the common Drachm‚ which may likewise be
eafily made ofone Size, according to the Rules (ᾗ 277.)
above prescribed. However, it is proper that this
W1.3ght be proportioned to the smaller Centner, and
