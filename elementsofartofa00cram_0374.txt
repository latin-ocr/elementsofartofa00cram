PROCESS LVII.

‘Ibe ProduHion of Steel out of crude unmalleable Iron, or
out ofits Ore, hy Fuston.

ῚᾸ Ῑ Ε shall here in a clear and general Manner give

the Method for making Steel by Fufion. Chuse
for Instance‚ Iron-Ore, or the Iron itself still crude
of the first Fufion, which we know can be rendered
tough and firm by being melted, made red hot, and
hammered. For, according as Iron, or its Ore is
different in its Kind, so you may make with it diffe-
rent Sorts of Steel‚ and with greater or less Ease, or
Difficulty. Put at one or several Times into a Bed
made with Charcoal Dust in a Smit'n’s Forge‚ such
Qantity of this Metal divided into small Parcels‚
as that the Metal remaining after the Melting of it
is compleatly performed, may not be more than two
or three common Centners3 not only that the Melt-
ing may be sooner finissied, but also because a small
Mass may be better and more equally penetrated
with the Vapours of the Phlogiston: Nay, they also
add, as a defenfive Menstruum‚ some of the
vitrescent sufible Scoria’S‚ either of Sand, or of small
Stones of the same Nature: Then put upon them
Abundance of Charcoal, light them, and admit only
a gentle Blast of the Bellows·, that the Scoria’s and

the Metal may both melt very well: Take out now Ι

and then Part of the Scoria’s, and often stirr the
² melted Mass with a Sticl<3 that all the Parts of it
may as much as poffible feel the same Degree of
Fire. Having at last removed the Fire and the Sco-

ria’S,
