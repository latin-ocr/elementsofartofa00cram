at the Extremity of the Hearth‚ which will at the
same Time hinder the Heat from affeffing the Glass· y
recipient. Finally have a small Recipient, full of
cold Water; let it be perpendicularly fituated43and
receive the Neck of the Retort in such Mamer, that
the Extremity of -it be hardly one half—inch immersed
into the Water ·, as for the rest, it is not neceffary
to stop the JointS.

2. Let the Retort be surrounded with hot burning
Coals‚ placed at some Distance, in F orm of a Cir-cle
lest the Vefl'el should burst by too sudden a Heat.
Then by Degrees bring the burning Coals nearer and
nemer, and at last surround the whole 'Retort with
them and with fresh Chai-coal: that it may grow
ssightly red hot. This Fire having been continued
for an Hour, let the Retortcool of itself. Then
strike the Neck of it gently, that the large Ders
which are always adherent to it, may fall into the Re-
cipient: When the Recipient 58&ngss away, wipe off
with a'Pencil the remaining sm'alf& Drops, and col-
le& them in a low open Vessel ‘set under, leaving
mean-while the Retort in its first Situation. Add
'this Portion of Mercury to the other already collested
in the Recipient. Let the Water be well lhaken first,
and decanted‚ and the Mercury be poured into a
’ Ρίὶῑωω, made of a two-sold filtrating Paper 3 that the
‘superfluous Moisture may be absorbed; and then
weigh it in a Glass·Veffel.

· 3.- If you have at Hand a Furnace having a Sand-
bath, this Process will be much more easily per-
·formed·, butrthe Pot which contains the Sandvmust
be middling red-hot, and the Retort be able to touch
· the Bottom of it immediately, nor is it then neceffary
that the Retort be loricated.
