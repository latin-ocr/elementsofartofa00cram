them separately. For the same purpose, likewise‚
we shall subjoin to the Description of every Apparatus,
the several ‘Manners of proceeding, and every Thing
moreover to be observed 3 lest all these Things being
dispersed, should avert the Attention from the De-
scription itself of the Work, or puzzle the Beginner.
But, it will not always be possible to fulfill every one
os the Rules hitherto el'tablii‘hed3 because the First
and Second chiefly, will now and then bear an Ex-
ception, to avoid a greater Inconvenience. For this
Reason, it is not always convenient to give the first
Rank to the more fimple Proceffes, because they are
performed with greater Difficulty 3 nor to give
it always to the more easy, because they require a pre-
vious Knowledge of some of the foregoing to be
brought to their Perfection. We must then be al-
lowed, to sele& several Series of Proceffes‚ and out
of these, well composed among themselves, to esta-
blish the most convenient Order. We then thought
it very proper, to begin with those Proceffes which are
made with Silver and its Ores: For in these, there
is no Neceffity but of a fimple Separation of the he·-
terogeneous Bodie53 anal even this is performed by
Additions more [imple than in the others ·, wherein,
besides this Separation, an intimate Combination of
the Phlogiron is required, fora Reduffion into a me...
tallick State. Next, the Effe& of the Menstrua, is
most commonly evident to the Senses, in Operations
made upon Silver‚ during the Affion itself: Where-
fore, the Degree of the F ire may be measured as
With the surest Thermometer ε Which does not suc-.
ceed so well in the Processes to be used for the other
Metals; because these, most commonly, must be
treated in close vessels, on account of their Destru-
Etibility. And this Destrustibility itself is the Cause,
why these Proceffes so seldom meet with good Suc-
cess·, because the Greatness and Duration of the De-
gree of the Fire, are very difficule to be exaffly de-
termined‚ and the Effe& while it is produced, can-
not be seen·, but, when the Process is finished, then,
