which is produced in the present Cuse, is Iron dis-
solved by the Sulphur of Antimony3 for which Rea-
son this Scoria is of a very hard Nature, and very
difficult to be separated from the Regulus. To make
it¹ separate easily you must add an alcaline Salt, or al-
calescent Nive, whose Acid is expelled by that¹ of
Sulphur: This Alcali dissolves the Scoria‚ and makes
it sofr and diffoluble by the Moisture of the Ais.
Likewise‚ the Heptzr Sulphum produced in the Ope-
ration does also efficacioussy diss'olve the precipi-
tating Iron, and retains it united to itself, lest the
Part of it which is dissolved by the Sulphur should
again unite itself so easily to the Regulus of the
Antimony.

2. A second Fusion is made with crude Antiniony
and Nitre, or with fresh :ilcaline salt, to the End
that the Iron remaining in the Regulus may be sur-
thermore separated. Por Instance, the Regulus which
is much more refracflory iu die l-''ire than the crude
Andmony, is diffolved by the Sulphur of it, and at
the same Time this Sulphur niceting the Particlcs os
the Iron contained in the Regulus, and having ahan-
doned the reguline Portion of the Andmony, joihs
with them ·‚ when joined, making a lightei· Mass,
it is cast up at Top, and forms a Scoria‚ in which a
great Deal of Antimony is adherent, sor want osa
precipitating Body. The Salt added over and above
has the same Effe& as ΝΟ. 1. But, it is easy to con-
ceive, that in this second Fufion, the Regulus is
tainted with some small Qantity of Sulphur.

3. To consume this Sulphur intirely‚ it is necessary
several Times to repeat the Fusion 3 which is not
made so well with alcaline Salt‚ as with Nitre : For
the lat‘ter being flung upon a Regulus boiling by the
Violence of the F ire, detonates with the Sulphur that
lies hidden in it, and at the same Time becoming
Alcaline by the Strength of the Fire‚ it affumes a
refrafftory Nature, which is increased by a saltlike
Tartar vitriolate‚ which is produced by the Acid of

the Sulphur, and the alcaline Part of the ΝΙίἓ-ε.
