here, but only as being improper. It contains a
uantity of Copper not inconfiderable‚ but it is

neglested‚ because the Cobalt wherewith it is incum-
bered, renders it almost untraehble. In the mean
Time you are to observe, that what renders Ores
iritrac‘cable, is not the Arsenick itself‚ but a kind of
Barth, which is always united to the proper Minerals
of Arsenick, especially to Cobalt (ᾗ 325), which resists
Fu fion very much, and by Means of the Arsenick that
is fixt in it, adheres with great Tenacity to Metals‚

especially to Copper and Iron.

Μὲῑγᾶἑὸ. &alena tefficlata, or the Cub1c Dice-Lead Ore,
called in Germany ἊΒῐερεςῐᾶηΐξ, is an Ore very rich ,of

Lead, consisting of a Quantity of small equilateral ·
Cubes, or of oblong Parallelopipeds. But these Cubes

are, as it were, composed ol very thin, well polished
Lamim's, that shine very bright‚ and are ofa black-
iffi blue Colour. However, this Ore is very ponde-
rous, sofr, and brittle ; it is more fufible than a great
many other Ores, though it requires a much greater
Fire to be melted, than Lead itself: the Cause of
which is the Abundance of Sulphur, that lies hidden
in the lead-Ore, and constitutes almost one quarter
Part of it. In a Fufion well managed, one hundred
Pounds weight of pure and solid lead-Ore, will yield
from 65 to 70 Pounds weight of Lead.

a very rich, somewhat malleable filver-Ore of a lead—Colour. See
