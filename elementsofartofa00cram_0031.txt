ASSAYING METALS. ’ἴς

to the Side ofthe Veffel‚ where it turns into Dross cal-
led Litharge. Then the Lead seems to boil and
smoak, and small Drops resembling the first Scorice
are incessantly produced, that swim upon the Lead
like Oyl, and are continually thrown towards the
first. If the Fire is kept at the same Degree, the
whole Mass of Lead at last turns into Litharge.

39. If you put Copper into Lead thus smoeking,
it eauses a much brisker Ebullition‚ and the Copper
as it were bursts, divides, and seems to become but
one homogeneous Mass with the Lead, which Mass is
brittle‚ and, when broken, its Surface‚ if there hath
been added about half as much Copper, will have
the Colour and Figure of a Piece of tempered Iron
or Steel.

40. Gold and Silver likewise melted with Lead,
become brittle, and Gold especially turns pale, by
the least Mixture of it.

41· Tin is melted with Lead‚ by a Fire not much
greater than what would melt both severally : But so
loon as the Fire is increased so as to make the Vessels
turn red, the Tin immediately rises above the Lead‚
like little whitish dusty Hillocks; so that one unikil·
led in these Matters would be apt to think that Coals
had fallen into the Metal: If they have been taken
'but a little while out of the Fire„ they look like burn·
ing Coals. Tin thus calcined, when grown cold, has
its Colour variegated with white yellow and red.

42. Lead‚ so long as it keeps its metallick Form,
can never joiri with Iron, though urged with ever so
great a Fire. “

43. Semi-Metals are easily melted with Lead by
Fire, and a great Qantity of them deprives it of its
Malleability.

44. This Metal must oftentimes be made into
small Grains, that it may be mix'd with the others,
and its exa& VVeight be more easily determined.

But this Comminution is best made the dry way, in
the following Mamer, which is called Granulation.

Put Lead in an iron Ladle'‚' melt it on a gentle Fir? ·
