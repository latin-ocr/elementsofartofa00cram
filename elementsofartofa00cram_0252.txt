scorified with Lead ε Because the Coppel cannot bear
any Regulus of Antimony : For when this is joined
with Lead‚ it splits the Coppels, and often corrodes
them to such a Degree, that the whole Infide of them
swesss like a Spunge. Therefore, after the Scorifi-
cation, you must have Regard to the Regulus alone,
to know whether its Brittleness and black Colour,
communicated to it by the Regulus of Antimony‚
will require the Repetition of the Operation. Bur,
you are previously to examine, whether the Anti-
mony contains Silver in it: Which may be done in-
tirely by the fame Method aiready described relating
to Silver. For the Regulus and Silver is precipi-
tated out of crude Antimony by Iron, Copper, Lead,
and Tin. But, before this Examination is made,
all these Metals must be tried likewise, to know whe-
ther any Silver remains of thern after the Scorification
and the Copelling‚ and what Qantity.

3. As Iron is of such Disposition in its Ore, that
it turns into Glass, by means of Fire alone, on ac-
count of its Want of a pure Phlogiston ·‚ it is plain
enough, why iron-Ore is fit to be scorified. with Lead,
without any previous Diffipation of its Phlogiston:
,although it be the only Ore refractory to such a De-
groe, as not to be brought without great Difficulty to
a sufficient Degree of Fusion, unless, it be joined to a
great Qantity of minei-alSulphur, or Arsenick.
