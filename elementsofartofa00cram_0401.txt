fore, it is proper to use large Aludels 2 By this Me·
thod you will obtain Abundance of Flowers out of
Calamine, especially if you break it into small Bits
of the Size of a Pea‚ and lay it in Szrata with Char-
coal ; when those are consumed‚ you collect it out
of the Alb-bole, and put it in again with fresh Char-
coal. Thus it is sometimes for a very great Part
resolved into Fumes and Flowers, according to its
different Degrees of Purity. These Flowers first
come forth bluish, then more and more grey, and
white at last. They are vastly like the Flowers pro-
duced out of Zink itself‚ and called Nihil album, Ni-
hilgrysbum, according to the Difference of the Colour‚
which nevertheless depends on the Impurities mixt
with them, or (if the Operation has been neatly per-
formed) on very small Portions of Zink not yet de-
stroyed, or from both CauseS. For, Zink may indeed
be collected out of them, according to Appar. N0. 5.
and if they are again made red-hot for a few Mi-
nutes, they grow perfeffly white 3 because Zink is
not very constant in the Fire. They are also called
Pompholyx .· And we shall leave to others the Care of
finding out, whether it is the same as the Pompholyx
of the Ancients, and whether the spodium of the
Greeks finds also its Place here : But, whoever has a.
Mind to fift these MatterS, let him not undertake
it without having Recourse to Experiments ; lest he
should afterwards give us Words for Things ·, nor
pretend to 'reconcile the various Opinions of all the
Authors‚ many of whom have stuck to Words much
more than to Things.

4. Pompholyx and Nihilum (Nil) are indeed sold
in Shop3‚ but seldom genuine: For, as they are
collected in small Qanffly, they are adulterated in
a thousand different Manners: While the several
Kinds of light white Marls, the Parget made of
burnt Spaad, and the white, fat, Boly EarthS, such
as the F ullers-earth, the Hestiaia-earth, &a or even
compound Maffes, made several Ways with
these, both by Nature and Art, are sold for the
