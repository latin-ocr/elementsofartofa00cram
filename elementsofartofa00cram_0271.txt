ASSAYING METALS. 245

towards the hinder-Part,which is deeper : Then take
out the Trough, and incline it a little on the fore-

Part ; that the Water may run out, and the heavier ,

metallick Part remain at the Bottom: Repeat this
several Times over, till the Ore remains quite pure.

2. If the Ore is inherent to a very hard Stone
hardly yielding to Iron, such as are Flinm, and the
other Stones of that Kind, or to a ponderous, cal· ¹
careouS, Spaad-like Stone ς it must first be weighed,
'and then be made quite red-hot in a Crucible‚ and in
this Condition be thrown into a Veffel full of cold
Water, and after that be pounded very fine and
washed very clean.

3. When the Ore is walhed, weigh it, and try
one Centner of it: that is, according as the Nature

’ of the Ore requires it‘ Thus you will eafily com-

pute, how much Silver or Gold you will be able to
obtain from twenty Centners of Ore.

The Ust and Reastms of the Process.

r. From what has been just said, and from what
was said (Part Ι. § 338) it appears, that every Ore
will not bear washing ; it lhews¹ likcwise what kind
of washing each Ore will require·, and what Ores
can be walhed without a Preparation: Of this last
Kind are those which confist of solid pure Particlesj
and lie hidden in a soft fat kind of Earth‚ or in Sand.
Thence, you likewise see, in what Manner they must
be previoussy poundecl, or calcined (Compare Part I.
§ 337). By Calcination, you not only break Stones
into Pieces with greater Facility‚ but Ores besides
melt into so'lider Maffes, which most commonly are
specifically heavier, on account of the Sulphur and
Arsenick in a Manner dispersed through thern.

2. The Intention of washing is, to render the Ore
more tractable in the Fire ; and to hinder the metal-
lick Parts from being difficultly precipitated‚ or
even totally detained by so great a Mass of semiss,
