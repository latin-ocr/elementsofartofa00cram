he Metal, it may be scraped off by a strong brietionz
{mkhich however may be done still quicker with a Grind-
¹5 one, or a delicate File, ifyou have thern at hand.Then

V ‘'wipe a flat and very clean Place (ς 288.) of the

Touch-stone, and rub against it the same Partjust
mentioned of the Surface of your Metal over and
ov‘er ·‚ till the flat Part of the Stone be equally and
neatly covered with a metallick Crust, one Inch
long, 'and oue Line and a half broad. This done,
chuse the Needle, that you shalljudge answers nearest
to the Metal rubbed3 which Choice is learned by fre—
quent Praftice. Theu wipe the lowest Extremity of
this Needle very well, and rub it against the Touch-
stone, as you did the Metal, by the Side of the first
Flam, and in a Direftion parallel to it. lf you can
find no Difference between both Plains·, you may
pronounce with Probability‚ that the Metal to be
tried is of the same Temperature‚ as the Needle you
have compared with it: whichTemperature is shewed
by the Number ingraved (ᾗ 290. andsoll.) upon it,
But if you find a Difference between the Colour83
chuse another Needle, in case you shall find the Metal
osa deeper or a lighter Colour than the first Needle ε
Thus you will at last. find a proper Needle, auswering
to the Temperature of the Metal ·, or at least you
will be able tojudge‚ that the Allay of Metal is exa
traordinary‚ and cannot be determined by your
NeedleS. ’

the whole Mass of the Metal may be dyed with a
spurious Colour‚ which may be produced many dif-
ferent VVays3 you may eafily see, from the Colour
of any Metal compared with your Needles, that you
ean pass no certain Judgment upon it, unless you
know that the Gold and Silver are min, and what the
Metals are wherewith they are so mixt: whether, for
Instance, it is Gold and Silver, Silver and Copper, or
all these three perfeffly pure, -without any Mixture of
¹another Metal. For, in this Cast, the Comparison
