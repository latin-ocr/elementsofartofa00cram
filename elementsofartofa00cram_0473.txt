APPARATUS.

HIS, as well as the foregoing Proceffes, con..

cerning Gfflsses, striffly speaking, do not, in-
deed, belong to the Art of Affaying. This Exami-
nation is performed by several Apparetlus’s, w'nich
you will find described in the hydrostatical Writers,
among which you may chusethat‚wl1ich‚ frorn Use and
Comparisom you willjudge to be most convenient ἦ.
Make the following Observations in general.

1. Have at hand Water distilled in a glass-Veffel
on a gentle Fire, that may sustain a Solution of Silver
or of Lead, without being turbid: For, fountaim
river, and rain-Waters‚ are too different.

2. Let the warmth o'f the Water and of the Body
to be weighed, be fixt : For, it may occasion a very
'great Difference: Which appears presently‚ if you
weigh in the same Water made warin, the same Body
that has been already weighed. For, it will appear
specifically beavier: Themisone, you must be provided
with a Tnerrnometer. But, you must clmse a Degree
not exceeding much the greatest Summer-heat, for
Instance 90, according to Ezhrenheit’s- Thermometer.
You must warm to the same Degree not only the
water, but also the Body to be weighed3 which
may be very well done in a Ball-250 Mariae.
