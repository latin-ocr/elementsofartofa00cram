ASSAYING METALs. 155

fo that there is sometimes a great Qantity of' Silver
got out of thern 3 nevertheless‚ cannot always be re-
ferred to this Class‚ unless you have, in some special
Case, found out by Experiments‚ that they contain

Silver in them: for we have not hitherto found out '

any certain Characteristicks, and outward Sigus, from
which we might decide, whether any Ores containSil-
ver in them, or no, And if any such Characters have
been found out, they usually are regarded only with
relation to the Mine that yields the said determined
Ores: so that People that do not use the necessary
Cautions‚ are often deceived in making an univer-
sal Application of such externa} Signs.

391· It is the same with, the lead-Ores: for the
more nicely striated‚ among these, the granulated
Ores (§374)‚ and those that have a changeable
Brightness‚ are referred to the Class of the Ores that
contain Silver : because, there is sometimes so much
Silver in them, that it is of greater Price than the
Lead thereto adhering. Some look upon them, and
not without Foundation‚ as real filver-Ores. But
this Rule suffers a great many Exceptions; while,
on the contrary, the lead-Ore confisting of large cu-
bical Parts‚ which is generally thought to contain
Silver, is of equal Value to that of the foregoing‚
with regard to the Silver.

392. Fiually, it is proper to forewarn every one,
not to be overhasty in thinking, that there is gene-
rally Silver &ontained in the Ores of Copper‚ Lead‚
Iron, &a because Silver may be extracted out of the
Lump, in which this kind of Ore predominates‚ or
'out of the Metal that has been melted from it : nay,
before you make your Experiment‚ and determine
any thing, you must previously and with great Care
chuse an Ore, perfectly pure, looking homogeneom,
and altogether free within and without from any ²
Mixture of Stones‚ that might perhaps conceal some
filver-Ores (ᾗ 384—388). For, unless you take
such an Ore for your Experiment, you will never be

apli: to conclude with certainty, from anySilver fetched
