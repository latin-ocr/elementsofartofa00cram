Use, 4. If you sprinkle Filings of lron or of Cop-
per, several Times, with distilled Vinegzw, and dry
them again over a warm Oven 3 they are both cor-
roded‚ and the' former turns to a triturable ‹iai-1<

Rust. ’

Brass is calcined by Fire alone, but being much
more constant when made red-hot, than pure Coppcr‘
(Proc. LXVI), you must calcine [hin Plates of it
in a strong Fue, in the third Chamhem taking Care,
⁴ mean while, that they do not mele : Because it, on
the contrary, melts much more quickly than pure
Copper. This Calx must be roasted again several
⁴Times, in a milder but long-lasting Firet

Lead is calcined‚ 1. without Additum, if you
melt it in a large Iron-ladle : It presently contr21&s

and thrown away with an Iron—lcrziper: For Copper‚
if there is anyin the Lead‚ likewise contains in it the
Filthiness wh1ch adheres to the Lead : Another such
Pellicle will soon be produced : Which must be taken
off, and kept : Continue thus to colle& the Peliicles
produced in this Manner, till you have gathered a

the fourth Chamber, and roasted in a gentle Fire,
stirring them now and then with τι small Hook, tiu ,

which being pulverized under the Nauio of Ccruse‚ is

get, and other Things: thnce the Glass-makers
whouse such Ceruse to make Glai's of Lead‚ lose both
their Labour and Materials. Ir you are wiliing to
prepare the best Ceruse of this Kind with Vinegar,
distil Vinegar of Wine‚ out of a Cucurbite through
an Alimbeck ful] ofthin Places of Lead, and so dis-
posed, that the small Drops which appiy themselves
to them, may neither sall into the (Luem-bite, nor
