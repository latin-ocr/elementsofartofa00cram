violently. But, the F lowers apply themselves pre-
sently to the Sides of the Veffel, and even adhere to
the Surface of the Zink itself3 nor can they after-
wards be further changed, or rendered volatile, by the
'same Degree of Fire by which the Zink has been
burnt and sublimed 3 so that by this Method you

may also adapt Aludels, or only cylindrical Segments‚
to the Orifice of your Veffel : By which Means you
will obtain a little more abundant and more subtile
Flowers. But, that the Surface of your Zink may
be now and then freed from the Flowers that cover it,
and the whole Cavity of the inferior Veffel be ren-
dered free, it is proper to make a Hole at the Side
of it, so large as that you may take out through
it the Sublimate, with a small Ladle, as was said
before.

3. When you apply suddenly to pure Zink the
strongest Fire with a Draught of Air 3 the whole of
it vanishes: Nor is it confined by the Crucibles
, being stopt with Lute. For Instance, if you put an
Ounce of pure Zink into a small Crucible covered
with a smaller inverted one, stopping all the Joints
well with. common Lute, and put it into a wind-
F urnace, surrounding the whole Vessel with Charcoal
and burning Coals, and excite the Fire to its
utmost Degree, by applying the Bellows to the
bottom-part of the Fumace, and continue it for
half an Hour, when afterwards you take out the
Veffel‚ you will not perceive therein the least F oot-
steps of Zink, or of the Flowers of it. The very
same Thing happens with the other Semi-metals‚
though not so quickly.

4. If you mix the white Flowers of Zink, or the
blue and grey ones calcined to a white Colour in a
middling open F ire, with common reducing Fluxes‚
“ such as are the black Flux‚ and the white (Part Ι.
§ 162. effe.) adding fluxing Salts to thern, they

cannot afterwards by any Means be reduced ins the
