ASSAYING METALS. ⁴457

seems to be the Reason why Allum 15 so lasting, such
as aie the Crystals composed of Alkali, andD of the
vague fossile Acid united together, and will not erhly
abandon its Acid m the Fire. For when it is made
middling r-ed hot 1n the Fue, there comes out a ve ry
little Qantity of Acid· and if tt is afterwards tor-

mented by the greatest ard longest Fire‚ you can
never extort any mme ofit ·, so that on this Account,
the Caput [Mortuum is most commonly looked upon as
mere Eat-th, which nevertheless is in the greatest
Part diffolvible by pouring hot VVater upon it, and
may be almost totally reduced again to its Form of
Allum, by a reiterated Evaporation and Crystaliza-
tion. But the Alkali is poured upon it not only be-
cause of the Precipitation of the Allum itself‚ but
also because of the Separation of the Vitriol‚ which
otherwise would be difficultly performed. You are
to take Care at the same Time, not to add too much
Alkali 3 therefore, it must be poured in by small
anfflies, to be repeated several Times, till you
are sure of a just Proportion. For the same Pur-
pose, an Addition of Lime is not useless, and even
must sometimes be substituted, for a greater Security.
As sor the rest, you must here make the same Ob-
servations as were made about Vitriol (Proc. LXXIV).

The remaining Earths and Dregs being exposed anew

to the Air, are again impregnatecl with Allum, but
not all of them.

These Proceffes about AHum, as well as those
about Vitriol‚ do not always agree so exac'tly with
thole which are performed m greater Qanffides, sor
a greater Proportion 1s commonly produced 1n larger
Operations. For several Artifices must be used in
every Case‚ which must be understood from the pe·
culiar Nature of each Mineral, by repeated Experi-

ments: Whence you must generally repeat a few
Times these ExaminationS, before you are able to

pass any certain Judgrnent.
