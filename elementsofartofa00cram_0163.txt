Mifhicz 3⁴ the grey one, in German 332&OEstss and
the dari< aih-coloured, in German 5ῗᾶῂὶ Ἡὶιῳῑπιῃῇἴίς,
described by Henckel‚ in Pyrilol. Pag. 195, 197, are
solid, ponderou3, and rendered white by Arscnick„
The first Species is distinguished from the white Py-
rites (ᾗ 323), by a Coionr somewhnt yellowiffi, bnt
the others are distinguissied from it, by a much darker
Colour z They at the sanie Time are all distinguished
by their greater Weight‚ and breaking smoother:
which is more exactly perceived‚ when yon compare
together the native Specimens of the Bodies to be dis·
cerned.
’ 368. There is also a copper-Ore‚ called by some
Virrean, and poffibly not very different from that
above described (ξ 363), except in the Qlantity of
Iro-n it contains : on which Acconnt it is harder than
the former, and of a darker Colonr: it melts with
greater Difficulty than the foregoing ones, and is ne-

, vertheless very rich in Copper. We mnst likewise

rank in the same Class, that kind ofdark red Ore which

- is almost ofa Liver—colour, and which is not easily

discerned by the bare sight, from an iron-Ore of the
same Colour.

369. The merely sniphnreons copper—Pyrites is of
a yellow gold Colour‚ with a light Tinctnre of green,
both within and without ς if yon break it, the Infide
has a kind of granulated Surface3 it is eafily beat
into Powder, and contains Sulphur and Copper in
many different Proportions, whence its specifick
Weight varies likewise very much. But ifit is very
rich in Copper, and at the same Time mixt with any
Qantity of Arsenick„ its gold-Colonr becomes yel-
lowiffi, {md when you break it, the Surfaces are
smoother, nemer, ancl more even. In this Cast, it is
called in German fflupfetsssslantff· Very often, it is of
the brightest Green and Blue, both at the Ouffide,
and between the Chinks: Nevertheless‚ if you break
it, and thus display a new Snrface‚ these Colours seem
not to penetrate through the whole Substance of it.
