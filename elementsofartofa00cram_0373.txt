unite to it: Which is thought to be so, because the
Iron thus changed, not only preserves its first Weight
(whereas when made red hot, it otherwise loses al-
ways a great Qantity of its Substance, which goes
away in F orm of scaly Scoria’s) but even proves to
have increased it a small Matter, unless too great and
long-lasting a Fire has burnt the Surface of it 3, which
the Scales going off from it do lhew. For this Rea-
son, the effential Difference between pure Iron and
Steel‚ confists in the greater Proportion of Phlogiston
more intimately joined to one than to the other.
Thence the Reason is likewise clear, why a too thick
Piece of Iron being put into such a Cement, or the
Iron-barrs not being left long enough in the Fire
with the Cement, they are only surrouncled with a
steely Crust, while the inward Substance remains
iron.

2. T hat every 0in Substance free frorn the Acid of
Sulphur, is fit for changing Iron into Steel‚ is plain
from the several Experiments of Workmen‚ some of
which use for their Cements a Multitude of different
Particles of the animal and vegetable Kingdoms‚
and yet all of thern produce the very same Kind of
Steel, provided the other Ingredients are alil<e: But
if you ernploy for your Cement any Body exhaling
Acid of Sulphur, or even Sulphur itself in a strong
Fim, you not only will have no Steel‚ but instead of
it the Substance of the Iron changes, and goes away
into a Scoria. For this Reason Sea-coals ζ’ are not
-fit to render Iron mallmble, nor to turn it into Steel:
Nay‚ Iron and Steel are more easily burnt and de·
stroyed by them, than they are by an open F ire

‘¹‘ Oui· Sea-ceals or Newcastle Coals, or in general all the foffil
Coals which cake in burning and run into Cinders, abeund with
Sulphur, and therefore are improper to be used about Iron, always
making it brittle ς but Pit-ceals, Kennel—coals, and Scotch-coak,
which burn to a White-afh like Wood, and abound more in a Bitu-
men, may be used in the first fluxing of the lron from the Ore, and
if the lron prove not so malleable as is required, this property may
be given to it by melting the Metal a second Time with W ood.
