duced out of them by repeating the Fufion.

2. However, though Iron, when melted alone, or
even with Copper, is most easily burm, and scorified 3
nevertheless‚ when it is once melred‚ and confounded
with Copper, it can never be entirely separated
by Fire alone, without the greatest Part of the
Copper be destroyed along with it. Therefore, ac-
cording to the Diverfity of the Ores, and of the
Skill they are managed with, there isa vast Difference
in Coppers produced by divers Proceffis, not only
from many different Ores, but even from Ores of
the same Kind: which Difference almost always de-
pends upon the Iron mixt with them: But, this is ea-
fily separated by a little Lead: For the latter that
can upon no Account be rrixt with Iron in a metal-
licl< State, dissolves the Copper, and rejects the Iron3
but thel ead itselfnot being able to sustain so strong a
Fiie, resolves partly into Fumes, and paitly into Sco-
ria. This is also the Reason, why a better Kind of Cop-
per is got from Copper-ores that contain Lead, and
’ from black Copper from which Silver has been se-
parated by an Eliquation made with Lead, than
would have been got, had Lead been altogether wanting.
Therefore, when black Copper containing Lead is
to be purified, it is not without Reason, that you
add to the remaining melted Copper, the fifteenth
Part of the portion, which has been lost in the
Operation‚ that the Qantity of pure Copper that
lies hidden in the black Copper, may be more exaffly
determined: On the other Hand, Iron has been so
much rejected in the foregoing Processes, that it
hardly deserves any Consideration: Which is like-
wise true of many other Bodies that are joined with
Copper. However, you must examine whether the
othei Circumstances will permit it: Because black
Copper is yet forneti nes full of a great Qantity of
Sulphur: But if the latter abounds? it is proper to
separate it before the Excoctiom by roasting, and
by a reducing Fufion‚ wlth {jn Addition ol 10 ne·
