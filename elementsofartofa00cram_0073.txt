ASSAYING METALS. 57

181. Therefore‚ Coppels made of Ashes of Bones
of Beasts, of Fish-bones‚ and of Spaad‚ are excel-
lent, as they need not be made very hot at first, and

⁷ will be necessary to make the Coppels pretty hot,

before you put the Metal into them: Which being
neglected, the aqueous Vapours forcing their Way
out, will cause the Metal to be thrown out in Drops 3
for Coppels of this Kind can never be perfeffly dri-
ed by the Air alone 3 there being always something
of an Alcaline Salt adherent to Wood—asties‚ which
attrac‘ts the Water out of the Air: As the dark Co-
lour of these Affics, and the Solution of Ammoni-
acl< Salt poured upon them evidently shew. For
which very reason, these Ashes are more dispostd
to Vitrification‚ than Ashes of Bones 3 for the latter
are nearer the nature of incombustible Stones.

Coroll. Hence likewise it is plain, why the dry
Powder (§ 175.) wherewith the Cavity of the Coppel
is done over, separates more easily in the Operation
of the Coppelling, when Wood-ashcs have entered
into the Matter of the Coppels: Which is vastly
prejudicial ·‚ because when these things adhere‚ they
either increase the Weight, ¹or cannot be got out of
the Bed of Metal, without something of it being
lost.

182. As to the moistening of the Matter of Cop-
pels (§ 178.) you are to take care, (ι.) Not to use a
Fluid too mucilaginous and fat: For this makes
Coppels so compact, that they not only reject vitri-
fied Bodies‚ and yield them a very ssow Pais-age, but
also split when made very hot, losing first their oily
Part. (2.) Not to use such mucilaginous Fluids, as
may produce a great deal of fixt Alkaline Sall in the
hearing of the Coppel; as the tartareous Dregs of
ferniented Bodies do. (3.) Not to rnoisten the
Ashes too much : sor then the Surface of the Cop-
pels is never pei-fcffly neat. (4.) Some mix about

one tenth Part of decanted Clay to the said (ἕᾸῗξ.)
