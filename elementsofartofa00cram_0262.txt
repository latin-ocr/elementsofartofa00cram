3. Then add at several Times some Lead reduced
into small Globules of a determined Weight: The
same Phenomena will appear, that were mentioned
(Pr-oc. Il). Go on with adding some Lead, and “then
diminflh the Fire a little, which must not be greater
than is necessary to keep the Silver in fufion: Conti-
nue thus, till the Silver is rendered quite pure:
Which may be guessed nearly, from the Examination
previously made of its Purity or Impurity, by the
Needle or by a docimastical Trial ·‚ and from the al-
ready consumed Quantity of Leacl, that was judged
neceffary for the Purifying of it. However, you
will be more sure of this ·‚ if, the Lead being con-
sumed, you thtust a moist iron-Wire into the melted
Silver, and look upon what adheres to it, the Instant
it is fetched out, to see whether itis become yellow‚
or white, polished, and malleable: If not, more
Lead must be added. The meited Silver must be
stirred sometimes with a erooked Iron (Part Ι. Plat.
IV. Ριζ. IX), towards the End 3 that the Lead pos·
fibly adhering underneath, may be intirely con-
sumed.

4. The Operation being finiffied, pour Water
Drop by Drop, or with a small Strean]‚ upon the
melted Mass 3 that the Silver may grow solid. When
it is so, take it out of the Test with a WVedge, rub
offall the Fiith and Albes adherent to it, with a brass-
Brush made of small brass Wires colleeted into a
small Bondle, pom-ing in the mean Time constantly
some water upon the Silver.

The Uss’ and Reasons of the Proceſs.

1. Take Care in this Process, that the Fire be not
continued too strong ε For by that Means the Tests

For the same Purpose, the Test must be put into the
Pit, and fiu'roundetl on all Sides with Affiess whereby
you hinder at the fiune Time the Pot that contains
t'ne Test, stom l‘plitting ancl falling down, and all the
