PREFACE

I Shall, in this compendious Worle‚ give the
Reaa'er the Elements of the Art of Affaying,
that is, that part of Chemistry‚ ‘which conssss in
a strio? Examination ofMineral5‚ by Affeans of
a proper Apparatus. I have written this chiefly,
that it may be <ff use to such Lovers of Chernistry
as apply themselves to the Study of mineral
Matters. For this Reason‚ficppcffing that some of
the slightest and most common chemical Preparati-
ons were in stirne mea ure known to the Reader‚
I have been very fhort about them, when I have
had Recouiss’ to them in the praelical Part of
*the docimastical Art3 except perhaps in some
Places, that required a more particular De-
scripti0n‚ as being little taken notice ofin the
common chemical Proceffes. Thercfore, I thought
it proper, previously to give a short andspecial
‘Theory of this Art, that those who should come
to the Proceffes, might already be acquainted
with certain⁸ Things neceffary to be known3 that
by this Means the Mind might be more compleat- „
ly iifirub'ted in the making of the Apparatus,
and the different Manners ofproceeding be more
eastly understood. I have begun this Theory by
an Explication of the leſs< compound Objefz‘s (ff
the Art, that these being found pure, might be
distinguished by their outward Form, or by the
