count, when you have a great many Coppels to
make, you may supply this Want with Afhes of Ve-
getables. But lest the Coppels should vitrify, be—
cause of the alkaline Salt adhering to these Ashes,
you must previoussy use the following preparation.
Let hot, white, and very light Embers made of
soft Wood, be strained through a Sieve by pouring
pure Water upon them3 that all the Coals that
happen to adhere to thern, may be separated, and
the best and finest Ashes may not fly away. Pour
upon this strained Dust pure and boiling Water·‚ stir
it with a Wooden Stiek ς then let the Alhes subfide
quietly, and theWater which swims a Top, and which
at first remains always troubled, be decanted: Pour
new VVater on the remaining Astoes, and after they
have subsided a second Time, decant it again:
Repeat this over and over, till the Water swimming
a Top proves altogether insipid : Then pour fresh
VVater again, stir it with the Wooden Stick, and af·
ter eight or twelve Seconds, pour it out as yet trou-
bled, into a clean Vessel: Part of the Affies will re-
main in the foregoing Veffel‚ in which the said walh-
ing has been made : Pour water upon this Remaind-
er, stir it and wash it likewise, and then, after a
short Rest, pour it into the second Veffel: Repeat
this in the same Mamer, till there remains at the
Bottorn of the first Veffel nothing but a little Scmd,
or some other eoarser CorpusculeS. Let the washed
Assies rest till they subside, and the Water swirnming
at Top be decanted softly. Thus you will have good
Barth, free from redundant Salt and Oil, and immu-
table 'oy Fire3 which, however, being reduced into
small Balls, burnt again in a Potter's Oven, and
then wafhed aneW, will prove better still.

175. Finally, put a small Qantity of Ashes of
the Bones of Beasts or of Fishes (ᾗ 171, 172.) into a
very clean Earthen Veffel, and a second Time calcine
them during a few Hours, in the strongest Fire,
wash them next with VVater, then grind them upon a
Porphyry into a most subtil Powder, to be kept lse-
