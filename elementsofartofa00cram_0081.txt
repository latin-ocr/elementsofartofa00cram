200. If you adapt to the Convex Mould (Plat.1.
Eg: XIII.) another Concave one (Plat. I. [ig. XIV.)
in the Manner described in the Explication of the
Figure just cited, so that the Clay between them may
be formed by a strong Preffure3 this will make
Muffels much more solid with less Trouble‚ less apt
to crack, and more capable to refist· the F ire. Now
this is done in the following Manner. Put Clay a
little drier than the foregoing, or that kind of Clay
which is improperly called French Clay ἕξ, into the hola-
low Mould, rubbed first with Bacon †‚ and with your
Hands extend it on the Semi-cylindrical Cavity of the
Mould‚ and against the Board at the hindei· Part
(Plat. I. Fzg. XIV. l m) then put upon the extended
Clay the Convex Mould, rendered smooth with Ba-
con 3 so that the Sides of it may be equally distant
from the upper Border of the concave Mould z Then
put upon it the upper Board (Plat. I. Fig. XIV. n. ο.)
with Screws belonging to it (g), and by means of
them press it s0, as that the Board put upon it may
touch the Body of the concave Mould : Which done,
press finally the convex Mould as much as poffible
against the other, by means of the hinder screws
(Plat. I. th. XIV. τ’. k) 3 then loose the Screws,
and after having taken away the hinder and upper
Boards‚ take out the Convex Mould : Which is done
by means ofa Screw (Plat. Ι. Fzg. XIV. hap) that
serves as a Handle. Thus you will have a Muffel
formed, Which is 'easily taken out of the cylindrical
Cavity‚ and from the Basls of which Segments may
immediately be cut off: Finally‚ dry it well, and
bake it as the fote'going ones (ᾗ 199).

201.When largerAsh-Veffels οι· Tcsts(§183.)are to·
be covered, they use large spheroidal Muffels (Plat. II.
Fig. III.) made of cast Iron, or they make Muffels of
the same Kind with may, and upon Moulds of the
same FIgure (Plat. II. Fig. IV). Then the Mass of
Clay is extended with wet Hands only from the Top

³⁸ lVinastr-Loarn ὶς as good as any.
† Black-Lead powdcx’d is better.
