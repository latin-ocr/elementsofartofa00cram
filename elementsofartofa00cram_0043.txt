position of Metals and Semi-Metals ·, which may be
still more confirmed by an Addition of Nitre. For if
the Nitre‚ which detonates with every sulphureus Mat-
ter‚ is cast upon Metals grown red hot in the Fire3
these Metals‚ under a very evident Detonation, im-
mediately change into Calxs and Scoriae3 because
without Nitre they never undergo so sudden a
Change, in the same Time and Degree of F ire.

94. But the Chemical Analyfis shews υς, that there
is a sulphurous or oily Principle of this Kind (§ 24.)
contained in every part of Vegetables and Animals ;
fince a great Quantity of it may be extraned thence,
by a strong Distillation.

95. However, it is observable‚ that Calxs and
Scorice (§90, 91, 92, 93.) are never sofar reduced by
'sulphurous or oily Matters, as to be by them restored
to their former Qantity ε Nay, there is always a part
of them destroyed: Which Loss does likewise vary,
according to the Diverfity of the Metal or Semi—Metal
employed, or to the Duration and Violence of the
Fire, by which the Calcination has been made3 ac-
cording to the quicker or ssower Reduffion of the
calm, and to the greater or less Purity and Fixedness
of the oily Matter itself‚ wherewith the Reduftion is
made.

Corollar. I. From these Things appears. the Rea,-
son of the Extraetion by Fire of the Metals‚ Iron,
Coppcr, &a out of their Marcafite. For, if they
are laid in Strata together with Coals, and then urged
by a very strong Fire, excited with a Pair of Bel-
lows, their Scorioe rnehing, running between the
burning CoalS, and extremely attenuated by the F ire,
is impregnated with the oily Exhalation of the burn-
ing Coa13‚ and thus reduced to a metallick Form.

Corollar. ΙΙ. As the Calxs of Metals melt in the
Fire, with much greater Difficulty than the Metals
themselves, whose Destruffion gave thern Birth ·,
the Reason is plain, why a much greater Fire is ne-

ceffary to reduce Metals and Semi-Metals from ἑὴῗίι·
