114 The ART os

dies, the specifick Colour of every one appears very
dfftinffly, when you rub it against a very black hard
Stone. If then the Colours of two or more Metals to
be affayed, are expreffed by large lively Spots made
near each other in the same Plane, after having rubbed
them against the Surface of such a stone, you will by
that Means eafily discern their Difference‚ 01· their
Likeness.

288. The Stone adapted for this Use (ᾗ 287.) is
called the Teuch-stone ·, which must have the following
Properties. 1. It must be of the deepest Black, lest
the Tincture of the Metal should be hindered5 by
spurious Rays of Light ssiining between them. 2. lt
must be capable of being pretty well polissied ε For
when too rough, the Colours of the Metals rubbed
against it, cannot be neatly perceived: And if it is
too smooth‚ the Metals are but faintly and slowly
scraped by it, especially Gold. 3. It must be neither
too hard, nor too soft: For Tripoly‚ Coal-dzst, and
§Tin-dhes rub off the small metalline Crusts: So that,
in a short Time this Stone, though ever so hard, ac-
quires too great a Smoothness : And when it is too
sost, it is eafily ground into a fine Dust, and con-
tracts Furrows. Theresore‚ black rough Marble3
or black soft River—Pebbles‚ are excellent lor that Use.
They must be made into a quadrangulas Prism, a-
bout one Inch thick, and two or three Inches long 3
which is the most convenient Figure for that Pur-

ose.
p 289. The Metals which are tried in the Manner
mentioned, are Gom, Silver‚ Copper, when pure, -or
mixt among themselves by Fufion, in many different
Proportions. But in order the better to find out the Pu-
rity and various Mixtures of these Metals‚ whenever
they are to be examined ; the Maffes to be tried are
compared with small pureMaffes of the same Metals‚ or
ofMetals mixt in a known Proportion, and designedly·
prepared for that Use‚ which are called Touch-need-
les, Now the 'aforesaid Metals‚ both those pure and
those mixt in different Proporti0n5‚ are made into
