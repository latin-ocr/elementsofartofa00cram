Difference, between the Ores of Arsenick and those
of Bismuth, but the greater or less Proportion of
either of them mixt with the other. But, when there
is but a small Qantity of Bismuth‚ it cannot be run
down with any Prosit, though Bismuth be not a
Thing of the lowest Value. But, when the Caput

or a small earthen Cucurbite, and place this

carried your Fire to a very great Degree of Bright-
ness, you will see your melted Zink suddenly take a
Flame of a green Colour, and at the same Time a
very thick grey coloured Smoke arife, which will be
pustied forward into the Recipient‚ like Cobb·webbs
fluttering in the Air, and cover the whole Infide of
it, and a little after hinder you almost entirely from
seeing any further. After you have continued your
Fire for an Hour or two ς let the Veffels grow cold,
