PROCESS XLVI.
{The Elatriation or Wafhz'ng eff Copper-ore.

APPARATUS.

ERE every Thing must be done as in the
Washing of the Ores of the foregoing Me-
tals: But you are to observe in a special Manner, that
the green and blue Okers of Copper (Part Ι. § 366.)
admit of no washing; although they lie hidden in a
soft and not very ponderous Earth: For, they are
very light, and are carried to very great Distances, by
Waters not very rapidly move-d. ’

2. The green copper-Ores, and the blue azure
ones <Pas-t Ι. §364‚ 365.) can never go through
any Roasting, without cleaving into a light blackish
Powder: And as Copper‚ next to Iron, is of all
other Metals the most eafily burnt away, if the roast-
ing is continued a little longer, or even repeated,
Part of the best Copper is lost, that can by no Means
be recovered. For this Reason, as the abovesaid
Ores are at once light and easy to be reduced to a
subtile P0w‚der they will not bear walhing‚ unless
they are adherent to Earths, or at least intermixt
between very ioft and light St ones, very easy to be
comminuted by a previous DRoasting: And even in this
Case some Lols or other is hardly to be avoided.
However, beware not to take for such Ores those,
to the Surface of which a small infignificant Crust
of the blue or the green Ol< er has applied itself.

3. The other pyritose, sulphureous, Copper- -ores,
inclosed in hard ponderousStones, on Account of the
Sulphur they contain, suffer, and even require a
Roa sting·‚ not only to the End, that the Stones may
be disposed to a more convenient Comminudon, bue

allo that the Ore itself rnay be rendered more Weighffi
