138 The ΛΒΤ of

Rust has been first wiped off·‚ but the Infide is com·
posed of convergent Striae like the Amianth. If you
break it in a transverse Direffion to its Striae, it is
like the breaking of Steel that is not tempered very
hard. It is ofa datk red Colour‚ very heavy and
hard. Moreover‚ it is almostffthe purest iron-Ore,
and mixt with a very small Quantity of Arsenick *.
But it is rendered refrac‘tory‚ by a kind of Earth not
to be affected by F ire, which may happen to be con-
cealed in it. On this Account, the white Regulus of
Iron, which is brittle‚ and very difficult to be ren-
dered malleable, requires the greatest Fire to be
melted.

350. Smiris (in German &chmetgss’ in English
Emery‚ and in Dutch fimatt'lh) is the hardest of all
the ison-Ores that are known : it is a little less pon-
derous than the Emori-stone, very refraerory, of a
brown Colour, and really contains Iron ; though the
extrac'ting of it is not worth the Charges: Where-
fore Workrnen pound it only, and use it to polish
Steel : it is likewise employed to cut Glass‚ and polish
certain Jewels.

351. Magmfia (in German ffirunsteim in English
Ilslangamse) is here and there nicely striated with
convergent Striae ε it has no certain Figure, and is of
a greyish black Colour. Itis frequently met with in
iron—Mines·‚ and itself contains Iron ς but the ex-
‹trac‘ting of the Iron out of it by Fire, never answers
the Charges, it being rapzoeious, and yielding no
other but friable Metal. It is of greater Use among
those that make crystal-Ghffes, to take away their
green or blue Colour, and to abate their too great
Transparency.

352. There is a kind of Ore not unlike the fore·
going (ξ 351), which is ofa dark grey Colour‚ flain-
ing, striated‚ and also containing Iron, but rapaci-

* Some Sorts of Haematites are so very rich in Iron, as to be caae
pable of taking so fine a poliffi, as to look like burnissied Steel‚ par-
t-icularly a kind called in Italian Pietra di Nicola.
