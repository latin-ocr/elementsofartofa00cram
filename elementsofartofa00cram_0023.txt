ASSAYING METALS. 7

ry great Noise‚ and with the Matter added, changes
in part into an Alkali.

22. There is also an aeid Salt, called Vagam Foffile
'found in Vitriol‚ Sulphur, Allom‚ nay, almost every
where: It is seldom pure, ifever3 but adheres either
to Metals (and chiefly to Copper and Iron) orto cal-
careous Earum, more commonly to those that turn in-
to Glass, nay to the very Flints·‚ or is mix'd with
inflammable Foffils. But what distinguishes it fron]
all others is, its being more ponderous and more fix’d
than all the other Acids that are known, which it
·drives out of its Matrices‚ mix'd with pure Water,
it grows very warm, it mixe's with common Sulphur,
accompanied with fat Matters of any kind. What
its Power upon Metals is, will be shevvn hereafter, in
our Chapter of Menstrua.

23. To this Class might perhaps be referred the
Acids of common Salt and Nitre. However, as they
can be extraCted by Chemists from these Salts only, it
is not very sure that they are found naturally any
where.

Corollar. It is a question whether there may be found
naturally, any true and perse& Alkaline salt, whe-
ther fix’d or volatile in the mineral Kingdom? The
former seems to be confirm’d by the Salt of the Spa
Waters, and by the Nitrasm of the Ancients: Marble,
and Stones either fetid or easy to be cleft, possibly
contain the latter. But both Points require a. more
accurate Examination. See Fr. Hoffmcm ἕ· and Henc-

24. Whatever is inflammable‚ is called among the
Chemists by the general Name of Sulphur. Yon find
it in the mineral Kingdom, always mix'd with Acid,
(ξ 22.) otherwise the pure inflamnmble Mineral, seems
not to differ from the vegetable and animal 3 nor cloes
