AssArxNG METALS. 411

this Matter has not been examined so closely, but
there remain still many Doubts about it. Ι shall
here in a‘few Words mention the Discoveries Dr.
Henckel the Author so osten quoted, has made by a
Multitude os ExperimentS‚ and communicated to us
in his Pyritology.

Viz. No Pyrites containing any Copper or Arse-
nick, turn of themselves to Vitriol, but they require
a 121ξῖἴεί (Ξέἶρῗιῗείξιιέ lton-pyrites, void of Copper ancl
Arsenick, turn to Vitriol by the Aetion of the Air,
and os the Things it contains, and this the quicker‚
as they are less compact: Such are chiefly those
which seem to confist of a Multitude of Fibres and
Radiz· gathered together. But there are a good many
’ Exceptions to this: For there are Pyrites of such a
Kind, that they perfist unchanged for whole Years
tossether.

&Therefore we see Copper and Arsenick refist this
Alteration of the Pyrites‚ and it likewise follows,
that there is another secret Cause hitherto unknown
of this Constancy of the Pyrites‚ because the Pyrites
which are merely ferreous and sulphumons, do not
at all turn to Vitriol of their own Accord. I have
exposed such Pyrites moderately pulverized and not
very hard, to the Injuries of the Air sor whole Years
together, but they perfist unchangeable to this very
Da .

ἶ. It is still less known, why Vitriol is found in
some PyriteS‚ if you but pour Wnter upon them after
the Roasting, while you find none in some others,
unless you have exposed them previously to the ΛΞΓ,
at different Times. It even seems that we are to
look in the Air for the Reason of this, as it carries
moist Vapours with it. And indeed the Acid ofSul-
phur has not the Virtue to resolve Iron into the Form
of San, without a sufficient Qantity of Water:

Nay, Οἱ] of Vitriol or of Sulphur itsels, Ἴ being mo-
'derately concentrated (though diluted with much
more Water, than it is when united still with Sul-

phur)
